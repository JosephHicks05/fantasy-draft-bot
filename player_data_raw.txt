2025 Outlook:
The reigning No. 1 fantasy receiver, Chase outscored second-place Justin Jefferson by a massive 85.5 points. His career year included nine top-10 fantasy weeks (three more than any other receiver), as well as the most routes, targets, receptions, yards, touchdowns and end zone targets (17) in the league. He has finished in the top 12 in fantasy PPG in all four of his NFL seasons, including top 5 in three of them. Chase became the league's highest-paid non-quarterback during the offseason and is a heavily targeted 25-year-old superstar on the league's pass-heaviest offense with an elite QB in Joe Burrow. He should be the first WR off the board and is a strong option with the No. 1 overall pick.

2025 Outlook:
It took a minute, but Robinson finally made the leap to fantasy stardom last season. After a slow start, the 2023 first-round pick averaged 23.3 touches, 120.9 yards and 22.8 fantasy points (first at RB) from Week 6 on. He scored 14 TDs and had at least 18 touches in all but one game (a blowout) during the span. Robinson finished top 5 among RBs in snaps, carries, routes, targets, touches, yards and fantasy points. Entering his age-23 campaign and working in an Atlanta offense that was the third-run-heaviest in the league last season, Robinson is primed for another elite season and should be under consideration with the first overall pick of your draft.

2025 Outlook:
Jefferson enters his sixth NFL season as one of the best in the league at his position. The 26-year-old has produced a league-high 7,432 receiving yards since his arrival in 2020, having put up at least 100 catches, 1,500 yards and eight TDs in his last three full seasons. Jefferson has finished four straight seasons as a top-5 fantasy receiver on a per-game basis and showed he was QB-proof in 2024, finishing top 5 in catches, yards and TDs with Sam Darnold under center. Darnold is gone, but 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy could conceivably be an upgrade in Kevin O'Connell's pass-first scheme. Jefferson should be one of the first players off the board on draft day.

2025 Outlook:
Barkley's first season with the Eagles started with a three-touchdown debut and never lost steam en route to a Super Bowl LIX victory and NFL Offensive Player of the Year honors. Despite resting at times (including all of Week 18), Barkley led the NFL in carries, touches and scrimmage yards, which led to a position-best 22.2 fantasy PPG. Barkley, who averaged a career-best 5.8 YPC, does carry some risk, though, as he enters his age-28 campaign off a season with an absurd 482 touches (including the playoffs). He'll need to sustain his elite rushing output, as he isn't a big factor in the passing game (outside the top 25 in targets, catches and yards). He nonetheless remains in a great spot behind the Eagles' terrific offensive line and should be off the board in the first round of fantasy drafts.

2025 Outlook:
The reigning No. 1 fantasy RB, Gibbs scored a position-high 20 TDs while dominating as both a rusher (fifth in yards) and receiver (top six in targets, catches and yards) last season. The with/without David Montgomery splits are notable here, however, as Gibbs averaged 16.3 touches and 18.2 fantasy points per game (sixth best) in 13 games with a healthy Montgomery, but 22.5 touches and 31.5 points per game (first) without. Montgomery is back, so Gibbs' touch ceiling may be slightly lower than a few other top backs, but with his skill set and Detroit's high-powered offense, he's undoubtedly a strong fantasy RB1. The 23-year-old should be one of the first players off the board on draft day.

McCaffrey returns for his age-29 season eyeing a bounce-back after an injury-plagued 2024 that limited him to three full games. McCaffrey wasn't even his usual, elite self during those weeks (13.0 fantasy PPG), though he did play 88% of the snaps and average 18.7 touches per game. Prior to the 2024 debacle, McCaffrey had finished six straight seasons ranked in the top 5 among RBs in fantasy PPG and he remains positioned for feature back duties in a good 49ers offense. There's obvious risk here considering the injury woes and age, but in weeks he's active McCaffrey will be an elite fantasy option.

Lamb is entering his sixth NFL season eyeing a bounce-back after missing two games and finding the end zone only six times in 2024. For many receivers, 101 catches and an eighth-place finish in fantasy points would be a career year, but it was a step back for Lamb after he led all receivers in yards, touchdowns and fantasy points in 2023. Despite Dak Prescott missing more than half the season, Lamb managed his third straight top-8 fantasy campaign and only two receivers accrued more touches. In his prime at age 26, Lamb remains one of the league's best receivers and he will get Prescott back this season. He's a solid WR1 option with elite upside who may come at a slight discount on draft day.

Nabers is coming off one of the best seasons by a rookie receiver in some time. The 2024 No. 6 overall pick led the NFL with a 35% target share and finished seventh or better among receivers in targets, receptions, yards and fantasy points despite missing two games and dealing with New York's offensive struggles. Nabers' massive target share allowed him a high floor, as he was a top-30 fantasy scorer in 13 of 15 games, including 10 straight to end the season. He appears to be the real deal and his outlook is even better in 2025 with Russell Wilson (and perhaps Jaxson Dart and/or Jameis Winston) under center. Nabers is on the short list of receivers who could lead the position in fantasy points and is a solid WR1 target in fantasy.�

After exploding for 1,486 yards on 105 catches as a fifth-round rookie in 2023, Nacua produced 990 yards on 79 catches last season despite missing six games and a substantial chunk of two others. Once he was full-go in Week 10, Nacua went on to handle a massive 37% target share (11.3 per game) and his average of 22.3 fantasy points during the span would have ranked second over the full season. He led all receivers in yards per route run (3.7). The one concern with Nacua is touchdowns, as he has only 10 in 28 career games, and he was limited to six end zone targets (53rd at WR) in 2024. That said, with Cooper Kupp out and Davante Adams in, Nacua remains well positioned for a massive target share in a good Rams offense that has led the NFL in WR targets each of the last two seasons. After finishing sixth in fantasy PPG as a rookie and third in 2024, Nacua should be off the board in the first round.

Incredibly, he ranked first in this class in YAC and broken tackle rate both last season and during his collegiate career. Jeanty's elite playmaking ability and a three-down skill set supply him with the upside to be the next elite NFL running back. He's positioned for a feature-back role right out of the gate and should be valued as a midrange RB1.

St. Brown enters his fifth NFL campaign as the only player in the league with 105 or more receptions each of the past three seasons. Compared to 2023, St. Brown actually saw a decrease in targets, receptions and yards last season, but offset some of that with a career-high 12 touchdowns and still finished as the No. 3 fantasy WR for the second year in a row. He remains an elite, short-range target, having paced qualified wide receivers in catch rate (81%) in 2024 and having now ranked top 5 in first downs per route run for the third year in a row. The 25-year-old is a heavily utilized target in one of the league's best offenses and a clear top-5 fantasy wide receiver.

One of the rising stars in fantasy, Achane is entering his third NFL season after an impressive 2024, in which he registered only the 12th instance over the last decade of a player producing 200-plus carries and 75-plus receptions in a single season. Achane has now scored at least 11 TDs in both NFL seasons and paced all RBs in routes, catches, yards and receiving TDs last season. He also put size concerns aside, appearing in 17 games and finishing ninth among RBs in snaps. Achane's play plummeted when Tua Tagovailoa was sidelined (9.8 fantasy PPG), but he was elite when his QB was under center (22.6), which is the more relevant number with Tagovailoa back for 2025. Achane's dual-threat ability locks him in as a solid fantasy RB1.

Collins is entering his fifth NFL season having established himself as one of the league's top receivers over the last two years. After breaking out with an 80-1,297-8 receiving line in 15 games in 2023, Collins posted a 68-1,006-7 line in 12 games last season. He was a top-10 fantasy WR on a per-game basis in both seasons. The missed games are a concern (he's missed at least two games in all four seasons), but he offsets that with elite play (top 3 in YPRR two years in a row). With Stefon Diggs gone and Tank Dell uncertain to play in 2025, Collins is ticketed for massive usage as C.J. Stroud's clear No. 1 target. He's a solid WR1 option in fantasy.

2025 Outlook:
Three. That's the number of wide receivers selected before Thomas in the 2024 draft and it's also the number of wide receivers who outscored him in fantasy during his rookie season. The LSU product finished in the top 5 among receivers in both yards and TDs despite ranking 29th in routes and 19th in targets. Thomas' volume will need to increase in Year 2 in order to sustain WR1 fantasy production and, while it's reasonable to expect that boost, it's worth noting he had six 10-plus target games with backup Mac Jones (22.9 fantasy PPG those six weeks) but zero with starter Trevor Lawrence (14.4). The bottom line is Thomas appears to be the real deal and, even with Travis Hunter added to the mix, he has a path to a massive target share in a Liam Coen scheme that was extremely generous to Tampa Bay's wide receivers. Thomas is a good back-end WR1 target.

Brown is entering his fourth season with the Eagles after finishing each of his first three no lower than 13th in fantasy PPG. Last season, Brown missed four games and saw a dip in targets (from 9.8 in 2023 to 7.5 in 2024), with the latter a product of the Eagles leading so often. Brown actually posted a career-high 34.6% target share and averaged 3.3 yards per route run (both were second highest among WRs, and he's finished five straight seasons in the top 8 in both categories). Brown was extremely boom/bust, as he posted six top-10 fantasy outings (second most) but was held below 13.5 points in six of his other seven games. The 28-year-old is once again positioned as Jalen Hurts' top target and can be viewed as a fringe WR1.

London is entering his fourth NFL season having handled an enormous 27% of the targets and 35% of the air yards in Atlanta during his first three campaigns. London ranked eighth or better among receivers in targets, receptions, yards, TDs, end zone targets and fantasy points last season, but his production was very boom/bust. The only two games in which he reached 20 fantasy points were 33-plus-point efforts (and one was in Week 18). London's ceiling and consistency are impacted by Atlanta's run-heavy scheme, but his hefty share of the targets should be enough to allow borderline-WR1 numbers, especially if Michael Penix Jr. makes a Year 2 leap.

Taylor enters his age-26 campaign as one of the few remaining clear feature backs. The five-year vet finished last season top 5 among RBs in carries and rushing yards, averaging a healthy 4.72 YPC along the way. Taylor did miss three games due to injury and has now managed just one full season in his career (2021). He's also struggled to make much of an impact as a pass catcher, having never finished a season top 20 in targets. Taylor's heavy rushing workload allowed him to produce good fantasy numbers regardless of who was under center last season and, while the lack of receiving will limit his ceiling, we should expect the same in 2025. Taylor is best valued as a midrange RB1.

His season started somewhat quietly, but he dominated once temperatures dropped and went on to find the end zone in eight straight games to finish the regular season. Jacobs also contributed in the passing game (15th among RBs in receiving yards) and has now finished all six NFL seasons 18th or better in fantasy PPG. Green Bay's feature back remains in his prime at age 27 and makes for a solid fantasy RB1.

Henry has now finished top 10 among RBs in rushing yards and TDs each of the last seven seasons, though he remains limited as a receiver (51st among RBs in targets last season). Henry is now 31 years old (ancient for a fantasy-relevant RB), but doesn't seem to have lost a step (top 3 in YPC and YAC last season). Henry's lack of targets limits his ceiling a bit, but his elite rushing output locks him in as a back-end RB1.

Bowers is fresh off a dominant rookie season in which he produced 262.7 fantasy points, easily the most by a first-year tight end. He was a featured player right out of the gate and went on to pace the position in routes, targets, receptions (112 is the most ever by a rookie, regardless of position), yards and fantasy points. Bowers' season could've been even better had he seen more goal-line work (he was limited to five TDs and six end zone targets). He is already an elite player and the 22-year-old figures to benefit from improved QB play now that Geno Smith is under center. Bowers should be one of the first two TEs off the board on draft day.

Since stepping into a starting role in Week 8 of the 2023 season, McBride has an enormous 28.4% target share (9.0 per game). He averaged 6.8 receptions, 69.3 yards and 15.4 fantasy points per game during the span. He was the poster boy for bad TD luck in 2024, totaling three scores (two receiving) despite finishing second at the position in targets, catches, yards, end zone targets (10) and fantasy points. McBride's TE-high 7.9 expected TD total speaks to his bad luck and, though he also didn't score much in 2023 (three TDs on 108 targets), he's a candidate for a big improvement in the area in 2025. McBride is a strong bet to lead all tight ends in fantasy points.

Irving is a strong 2025 breakout candidate following an impressive rookie season. The fourth-round pick didn't play on over half the snaps in a game until Week 6, but was fantasy's No. 10 RB from that point on. He produced 15-plus fantasy points in nine of his final 12 games, with injury responsible for two duds. Irving's efficiency was elite, as his 5.4 YPC, 2.5 YAC, 90% catch rate and 7.5 RAC were all top 5 among RBs. Irving will defer some work to Rachaad White, and his 192-frame raises obvious durability questions, but he looked the part as a rookie and is well positioned for 15-plus touches per game in a good offense. At worst, he's a fringe RB1.

2025 Outlook:
A fifth-round flier back in 2023, it's no surprise Brown was a committee back to begin his career. That changed when Zack Moss went down for the season in Week 8 last season. From Week 9 on (eight games), Brown played 88% of the Bengals' snaps, averaging 18.9 carries, 5.5 targets, 23.6 touches, 116.3 yards and 20.6 fantasy points per game (fourth highest). He ended up seventh or better among RBs in routes, targets and catches on the season. The 25-year-old is in a good spot as the top receiving back in a pass-heavy, high-scoring Bengals' offense, and he has minimal competition for touches with Samaje Perine and Tahj Brooks next up on the depth chart. Brown is safest as a good RB2, but there's upside for more.

2025 Outlook:
Higgins signed an extension with the Bengals during the offseason and will return as Ja'Marr Chase's running mate. Higgins has struggled with injuries (he's missed action in four straight seasons), but he's been very impactful when healthy. In 12 games last season, Higgins posted career-high marks in TDs (10) and fantasy PPG (18.5), both of which ranked top 6 at the position. Higgins was a top-20 fantasy scorer in seven of his 12 active weeks. The 26-year-old may be the clear No. 2 behind Chase, but he also benefits from the league's pass-heaviest offense with an elite QB in Joe Burrow. Higgins is a good WR2 target.

2025 Outlook:
Hill is eyeing a rebound campaign following what was undoubtedly the most disappointing season of his career. Granted, he wasn't fully healthy, but Hill appeared in all 17 games and still managed to see a massive dip in targets, catches, yardage, TDs and fantasy points, compared to his first two seasons in Miami. Hill finished 31st among WRs in fantasy PPG after ranking no lower than 11th the prior seven seasons. It didn't help that Tua Tagovailoa missed six games (Hill averaged 9.0 PPG in those weeks), but he wasn't his usual, elite self even with Tagovailoa (14.9 PPG). Hill was the No. 2 fantasy WR three of four seasons before the 2024 dud, so a potential rebound season is worth factoring in, but it's not a lock as he enters his age-31 campaign. He's safest as a WR2 with upside.

McConkey is entering his second NFL season following an impressive rookie campaign in which he ranked in the top 20 among receivers in receptions, yards, TDs, catch rate, yards per target and yards per route run. Following a bit of an inconsistent start, McConkey heated up down the stretch and ended up 12th in fantasy points (18th in PPG). Including the playoffs, the 2024 second-round pick caught five or more passes in eight straight games to end the season. The 23-year-old has already emerged as Justin Herbert's top target and his short-to-intermediate role puts a 100-plus catch season in play in 2025. The arrival of Tre Harris and Keenan Allen could damper McConkey's upside a bit, but he's still a safe WR2 target.

2025 Outlook:
Adams signed with the Rams and figures to operate as the team's de facto Cooper Kupp replacement opposite Puka Nacua. Adams' age (32) is an obvious red flag, but he didn't show signs of slowing down last season. Despite missing three games and being traded, Adams delivered five top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied for fourth among WRs. Adams has now finished top 15 in fantasy PPG each of the past 10 seasons and, while he won't be the No. 1 target in Los Angeles, there are more than enough targets to go around in Sean McVay's scheme with Matthew Stafford under center (the Rams have led the NFL in WR targets each of the last two seasons). He's no longer an elite fantasy option, but Adams is a fine WR2 target with back-end WR1 upside.

2025 Outlook:
The reigning NFL MVP is back for his eighth season, having finished each of the last five as the No. 1 or No. 2 fantasy QB. Though he wasn't asked to throw as often last season (482 attempts ranked 14th and marked his fewest since 2019), Allen substantially cut down on turnovers (career-low five INTs) and remained a major force with his legs (he's finished top 5 among QBs in carries and rush TDs in all seven seasons). Still in his prime at age 29, Allen's dual-threat ability and a solid, slightly improved supporting cast sets him up for another elite fantasy campaign in 2025.

2025 Outlook:
The reigning fantasy QB1, Jackson outscored QB2 Josh Allen by a hefty 51.3 points in 2024. He remained his usual elite self as a rusher (he's finished first or second among QBs in rushing yards all seven seasons), but also made a huge leap as a passer (career highs in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs, as well as a career-low four INTs and a league-high 8.8 YPA). The only "knock" on Jackson that is relative to other top fantasy QBs is rushing TDs (he has 14 total over the last four seasons and had zero carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line last season), but he does more than enough otherwise to provide elite fantasy output. With an almost-identical supporting cast to 2024, we should expect more of the same from the 28-year-old this season.

2025 Outlook:
Daniels is entering his second NFL season after what was arguably the greatest rookie season ever by a quarterback. The dual-threat playmaker was productive as a passer and even better as a rusher, ranking no lower than third among QBs in carries, rushing yards, rush TDs, carries inside the 5 and scrambles. Daniels produced 355.8 fantasy points, which trails only Cam Newton (370.3) for most by a rookie. He showed a high ceiling, having delivered 24-plus points in eight games, including his final five full regular-season outings). Entering Year 2 with an even better supporting cast that now includes Deebo Samuel Sr. and Laremy Tunsil, Daniels has a strong case to be the first QB off the board in fantasy drafts.

Hurts returns for his fifth season as the Eagles' starting QB. He averaged 22.2 fantasy points per game during his 14 full regular-season outings in 2024, which ranked third among QBs and was the second highest of his career. He wasn't asked to do much with his arm (20th or lower in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs), but he dominated on the ground (he's led all QBs in rushing attempts, TDs and carries inside the 5 four seasons in a row). Hurts is entering his age-27 season with essentially the same elite supporting cast he had in place during last season's top-10 fantasy campaign (his fourth in a row). The reigning Super Bowl MVP is a top-5 fantasy option.

2025 Outlook:
One of fantasy's most productive backs over the last two seasons, Williams has scored 31 touchdowns (tied for most among RBs) and averaged 18.8 fantasy PPG (fourth highest) during the span. Last season, he paced all backs in snaps and carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (19), while ranking no lower than seventh in carries, rushing yards, touches and TDs. He had an extremely high floor (28th was his worst weekly finish) despite limited work as a receiver (outside the top 25 in receptions and yards for the second straight season). Williams' 610 touches over the last two seasons (third most) is a moderate concern, but he's in his prime at age 25 and well positioned as the Rams' feature back. He should be valued as a fringe RB1.

2025 Outlook:
Cook enters his fourth NFL season as one of the trickiest evaluations in fantasy. On one hand, Cook operates in a three-headed committee (albeit as the starter), which limited his carries (19th among RBs last season), targets (34th), touches (22nd) and total yardage (21st) last season. On the other, he's an explosive playmaker (4.87 YPC) in an elite offense who tied for the NFL lead 16 rushing touchdowns in 16 regular season games last season. Cook is obviously a strong bet for touchdown regression to the mean (especially considering he had nine TDs during his first two seasons), but the 25-year-old gets enough run in a great offense to produce starting-caliber fantasy numbers. Value him as a fringe top-15 back.

Smith-Njigba is entering his third NFL season following a breakout 2024 in which he ranked top 10 among wide receivers in routes, receptions, yardage and fantasy points (19th in PPG). Operating primarily in a short-area role, "JSN" was, however, limited to six TDs and ranked 16th in end zone targets (11). The 2023 first-round pick got more downfield opportunities in 2024 than he did as a rookie and perhaps will get even more in 2025 with DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett out and Cooper Kupp in as his wide receiver running mate. Smith-Njigba will also have a new playcaller (Klint Kubiak) and quarterback (Sam Darnold), which adds some uncertainty, but the bottom line is he's an emerging star and, at 23 years old, younger than some incoming rookies. Smith-Njigba is a WR2 who could crack the top 10 with another leap forward.

Many benefited from the arrival of Jayden Daniels in Washington last season, but perhaps no one more than McLaurin. The six-year vet caught 13 touchdowns (second most) after totaling 24 during his first five seasons and finished a career-best seventh (15th in PPG) in fantasy points. Despite the success, there is some "sustainability" concern here, as McLaurin's volume didn't change much from years past and he finished outside the top 30 in routes and target share. He's finished exactly 19th among WRs in targets three seasons in a row and has never finished higher than 15th in catches or ninth in yards. McLaurin will require a boost in usage to offset TD regression to the mean in order to sustain WR1 numbers. He's best valued as a mid-to-back-end WR2.

Wilson is entering his fourth NFL season having produced at least 148 targets, 83 catches and 1,042 yards in each of his first three campaigns. Despite the presence of Davante Adams for two-thirds of last season, Wilson posted career highs in catches, yards and TDs. He finished sixth or better among WRs in targets all three seasons, but has yet to finish a season better than 20th in fantasy PPG due to underwhelming TD totals (14 in 51 games). Wilson's assured of a hefty target share, which will keep him fantasy-relevant, but his overall volume may suffer with dual-threat Justin Fields now under center. Wilson will need a lot to go right in order to produce at a WR1 level, so the 25-year-old is best viewed as a fringe top-20 receiver.

He'll defer some carries to Najee Harris and targets may be limited in the Jim Harbaugh/Greg Roman scheme, but there will be enough volume to allow RB2 fantasy production.

Kamara returns to New Orleans for his ninth NFL season following an impressive, albeit injury-shortened 2024 campaign. Appearing in 14 games, Kamara soaked up 228 carries (12 off his career high) and led all backs in targets. He has yet to finish a season lower than fifth among RBs in targets, or lower than ninth in catches and receiving yards. That has translated in fantasy, as he's finished eighth or better in fantasy PPG in seven of his eight seasons. On the concerning side is durability, as Kamara hasn't played a full regular season since his rookie year (2017) and is now 30 years old. Additionally, the Saints' offense figures to struggle following Derek Carr's retirement. Kamara's clear path to touches and elite receiving work keeps him in the fringe RB1 discussion, but there's obvious risk here.

The reigning NFL Comeback Player of the Year, Burrow rebounded from an injury-plagued 2023 by proceeding to pace the NFL in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs. He appeared in 17 games for the first time in his career and contributed enough with his legs to end up third among QBs in fantasy points. Burrow, who was off target on a league-low 11% of his attempts, has now finished eighth or better in fantasy points each season he's appeared in more than 10 games (fourth or better in the last two). He'll continue to benefit from the league's pass-heaviest offense, as well as the terrific Ja'Marr Chase/Tee Higgins duo. Burrow's limited rushing output is all that stops him from joining the elite fantasy QBs, but he's nonetheless a very good starting option.

With Deebo Samuel Sr. traded and Brandon Aiyuk (knee) expected to miss significant game action, Kittle has a case to be the top tight end off the board on draft day entering his ninth NFL season.

He ran well (4.8 YPC) and was busy near the goal line (he ranked fifth with 17 carries inside the 5-yard line), but he struggled as a receiver (RB-worst 3.2 YPT). With Jonathon Brooks (ACL) out for the entire 2025 season, Rico Dowdle and rookie Trevor Etienne are Hubbard's primary competition for touches. The 26-year-old makes for a solid RB2 target.

Henderson was selected by New England in the second round of April's draft. The Ohio State product paced this rookie RB class with 7.1 YPC last season and was effective as both a rusher and receiver throughout his collegiate tenure. His size could limit his carry total a bit in the pros, but he impressed across the board athletically at the combine and his elite pass-blocking skills and three-down ability will make him a terrific fit in the modern NFL. Henderson figures to share some work with Rhamondre Stevenson, but there's plenty of upside here and he can be valued as a RB2.

Walker is entering his fourth NFL season eyeing a bounce-back after injuries limited him to career-low marks in touches, yardage and touchdowns in 2024. The good news is that the 2022 second-round pick remained Seattle's clear feature back and was productive when active. In those 11 games, he averaged 18.1 touches, 79.3 yards and a career-high 16.5 fantasy points per game. Despite the missed action, Walker hit career-best marks in targets, catches and receiving yards thanks to a hefty 14% target share (fifth highest among RBs). Still only 24 years old, Walker is a prime rebound candidate and the boost in receiving work (assuming that sticks under new OC Klint Kubiak) adds to his ceiling. Walker is a solid RB2 target.

2025 Outlook:
Harrison is a candidate for a Year 2 leap after he didn't quite live up to the "fourth overall pick" hype as a rookie. In some ways, Harrison was afforded plenty of opportunity -- he ranked third in the league in end zone targets (17) and ninth in air yards (1,518) -- but he was limited in other ways (zero designed screens and a deep-threat role that led to an ugly 54% catch rate and 22% off-target rate). Harrison scored eight TDs, but finished 37th in catches and 30th in both yards and fantasy points (41st in PPG). There's some obvious risk here, but Harrison was drafted with the expectation he'd be an elite player and it's only logical that he'll be treated that way in terms of usage in his second season. If that happens, the sky is the limit in terms of fantasy production. There's some projection here, but Harrison should be valued as a fringe WR2.

2025 Outlook:
Metcalf was traded to Pittsburgh after spending his first six NFL seasons in Seattle. Metcalf has proven durable (he's missed three games in his career), but he hasn't quite lived up to lofty expectations. Despite leading the NFL (by 10) with 96 end zone targets since entering the league, Metcalf has finished one season in the top 20 among WRs in fantasy PPG (10th in 2020), though he has finished top 25 in four of his past five seasons. His vertical role has limited his catch total and his scoring has underwhelmed lately, as well (6.3 TDs per season since 2022). With minimal mouths to feed in Pittsburgh, Metcalf is assured of a big target share courtesy of Aaron Rodgers and has the look of a fringe WR2.

2025 Outlook:
McMillan was selected by Carolina with the eighth pick of April's draft. At 6-foot-4, 219 pounds, he is one of the biggest WRs in this class and his game has led to many Drake London comps. McMillan handled a massive 34% target share and class-high 52% air yard share last season at Arizona. His elite size and ball skills combo supplies him with big-time fantasy upside and, with Xavier Legette and Jalen Coker as his top competition for work, he's well positioned for a sizable rookie-season role. McMillan should be valued as a WR2/3.

2025 Outlook:
The Chiefs selected Worthy in the first round last year and the speedster was a major difference-maker right out of the gate. He was involved as both a rusher and receiver, dominating with the ball in his hands (his 7.0 RAC was ninth best among WRs). Perhaps the most notable nugget pertaining to Worthy is his late-season emergence. He handled a hefty 26% target share (8.7 per game) in his final six games (including the playoffs) and scored at least 19 fantasy points in five of those games. Working with a QB (Patrick Mahomes) who has finished top 10 in passing yards and TDs seven straight years, as well as with Travis Kelce aging and Rashee Rice facing a six-game suspension after missing most of 2024, the 22-year-old Worthy is well positioned for a big breakout. He's an intriguing WR2 target.

Evans is back for his age-32 campaign having now put up 1,000-plus receiving yards in 11 straight seasons to begin his career. The future Hall of Famer missed three games in 2024, but still scored double-digit touchdowns for the fourth time in five seasons. Incredibly, Evans has never finished a season worse than 23rd in fantasy points (26th in PPG). Age aside, there are some concerns here, as Evans was very boom/bust in 2024, having posted six top-10 fantasy outings (second most), while also falling short of 12 points in seven of his other eight games. He also benefited massively from Chris Godwin's season-ending injury, averaging 6.3 targets and 13.6 fantasy PPG with him, but 9.1 targets and 20.7 PPG without. Despite the concerns, Evans hasn't shown signs of slowing down and has a good QB in Baker Mayfield. He's a fringe fantasy WR2.

2025 Outlook:
Moore has emerged as one of the league's most reliable and consistent players, having missed only two games in his seven-year career while finishing each of the past six seasons as a top-25 fantasy receiver. Working in a crowded Chicago WR room with a rookie QB last season, Moore did see a dip in fantasy output (from ninth in PPG in 2023 to 28th in 2024), but he was still very productive, finishing ninth among WRs in targets and receptions. Moore did improve dramatically in the second half of the season (11.1 fantasy PPG during Weeks 1-10, but 17.3 in eight games once OC Shane Waldron was fired), which is notable as Ben Johnson takes over the offense. Entering his age-28 season, Moore is a fine WR2 target and a career year is very possible if Caleb Williams makes a Year 2 leap.

2025 Outlook:
The 2024 season was a major disappointment for the Jets and that also applies to Hall's fantasy output. The 2022 second-round pick was a clear-cut fantasy RB1 during his first two seasons (eighth in PPG in 2022, sixth in 2023) prior to falling to 17th in 2024. Hall remained a clear lead back (only four RBs played more snaps) and was a force as a receiver (top 5 in routes, targets, catches and yards for the second season in a row), but pedestrian efficiency and rushing volume kept him outside the top 12 RBs in touches, yards and TDs. Hall is a good back and in his prime at age 24, so there's certainly so post-hype appeal in a new scheme with Justin Fields in at quarterback, but it's also likely that he'll share more work with Braelon Allen. Hall is best as a mid-range RB2.

Swift returns as the lead back in Chicago after a solid first season with the team. He appeared in every regular-season game for the first time in his five-year career, finishing 10th in carries and 14th in targets among RBs. Swift was effective as a pass catcher, but his rushing efficiency wasn't great (career-low 3.8 YPC) behind a shaky line and he struggled to find the end zone (six TDs). Incredibly, Swift has now finished between 15th and 21st among RBs in fantasy points in all five NFL seasons. He'll benefit from the arrival of new coach Ben Johnson and a much-improved line in 2025, so the dual-threat, 26-year-old remains squarely on the fringe-RB2 radar.

Flowers is back for his third NFL season after posting very similar numbers in each of his first two campaigns. He was utilized downfield more in 2024 than he was as a rookie, which boosted his yardage total, but he saw a dip in catches and TDs. He's finished outside the top 20 receivers in receptions, TDs and fantasy points in both seasons and simply didn't have enough quality fantasy outings last season, as he scored 18-plus points five times (all prior to Week 10) and fewer than 12 points in 11 games. The 24-year-old is the No. 1 receiver in Baltimore's elite offense, but the scheme simply limits his fantasy ceiling. He's best valued as a good WR3.

Sutton ranked top 3 in both air yards and end zone targets and he's now finished in the top 10 in end zone targets three seasons in a row. Sutton has yet to finish a season in the top 25 in fantasy PPG, but he's emerged as the clear top target (25% target share last season) for a Broncos offense that is much improved with Bo Nix under center. Sutton, 29, is a solid WR3 option.

Ridley is back for his second season as the Titans' top receiver. His first season was solid, especially considering the team's QB issues, and he's now produced just over 1,000 scrimmage yards two seasons in a row. Ridley led the NFL in air yards (1,849) last season, which allowed him a few big plays and somewhat offset a big usage dip near the goal line (he scored eight TDs and led the NFL with 25 end zone targets with Jacksonville in 2023, but fell to five TDs and four end zone targets in 2024). Ridley has finished one season better than 18th in fantasy PPG (two better than 24th) and, while his positioning atop the depth chart in Tennessee keeps him in the WR3/flex mix, his upside will be determined by the play of No. 1 pick Cam Ward.

Smith has posted a target share of at least 22% in all four seasons, and the Eagles' high-scoring offense has allowed him seven-plus TDs in three straight campaigns. Smith's output is a bit volatile due to the presence of heavily targeted A.J. Brown in an offense that leads off with Saquon Barkley and Jalen Hurts, and leans heavily on them near the goal line, but there is just enough volume and scoring opportunity here to keep Smith in the weekly WR3 mix.

2025 Outlook:
Waddle enters his fifth NFL season after a somewhat inexplicable down year in 2024. Granted, he wasn't fully healthy at times (and missed two games), but Waddle's target share dipped from 20%-plus during his first three seasons to 16% last season (56th among WRs). He posted career-low marks in every key category and ranked 52nd in fantasy PPG after finishing 21st or better in each of his first three seasons. Same as Tyreek Hill, Waddle seemingly suffered from Miami facing two-high safeties at a league-high rate, and with both back for 2025, we may see more of the same. Waddle has the talent to allow a bounce-back campaign (especially with Hill entering his age-31 season), but he can't be trusted as more than a WR3.

Jeudy is entering his sixth NFL season fresh off a career year in which he paced all wide receivers in snaps (1,006) and finished no lower than 12th in routes, targets, catches, yards and fantasy points (23rd in PPG). Jeudy's season may have been even better with improved early-season QB play, as, from Week 8 on (after Deshaun Watson's season-ending injury), Jeudy ranked sixth among WRs in fantasy points. Touchdowns continue to be a limitation for Jeudy, as he scored only four in 2024 and he has never cleared six in a single season. The 26-year-old has finished as a top-25 fantasy WR two of the past three seasons and is the clear No. 1 target in a Browns offense with some QB uncertainty. The output may be inconsistent, but he's well worth considering for your WR3 slot.

2025 Outlook:
The No. 12 overall pick back in 2022, Williams finally broke out last season after barely seeing the field his first two years in the league due to suspensions and injuries. The explosive playmaker was involved as both a rusher and receiver, which helped him to 1,062 scrimmage yards (18th among WRs) and eight TDs in 15 games. A top-7 finisher in YPR, YPT and RAC, Williams finished 25th at the position in fantasy PPG despite sitting outside the top 40 in targets and catches. A boost in volume will be important to Williams' consistency moving forward, but the 24-year-old will continue to benefit from Detroit's high-scoring offense. No lower than third in target priority, Williams is best valued as a fringe WR3 who very well could take another step forward in his second "full" season.

2025 Outlook:
Rice is undoubtedly one of the biggest wild cards in fantasy football this season. On one hand, he has been an absolute fantasy superstar since taking on a substantial role midway through his rookie season in 2023. During that span (nine regular-season games), Rice is averaging 19.5 fantasy PPG. In three full games last season, he handled a massive 36% target share (10.7 per game) and averaged 21.6 PPG (17-plus in all three). On the other hand, Rice is suspended for the Chiefs' first six games, he tore his LCL in Week 3 last season and, even when active, he now has legitimate target competition via Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown and Travis Kelce. The good news is that 25-year-old Rice is expected to be fully healthy upon his return and will be a featured target in a good offense. He has WR1 upside, but the suspension knocks him down to midround flier territory.

His receiving line dipped across the board (from 86-889-10 on 121 targets to 60-726-7 on 84 targets), though it's notable he got back on track to some extent after a slow start. After averaging 2.8 targets (11% team share) and 7.1 fantasy points during his first six games, LaPorta leapt to 6.7 targets (21% share) and 13.6 fantasy points in his final 11 (including the playoffs). Those numbers are nearly identical to his rookie season and closer to what we should expect moving forward. Working in Detroit's elite offense, LaPorta is a solid TE1.

2025 Outlook:
Mahomes enters his age-29 season no longer an elite fantasy option, but rather a solid mid-to-back-end starter. After five straight seasons as a top-6 fantasy QB (PPG), he's finished 13th and 11th the past two seasons. Mahomes has evolved into a quarterback who still attempts a ton of passes (exactly third in pass attempts four years in a row), but is more conservative (career-low 6.4 aDOT and 6.8 YPA in 2024) and doesn't throw as many TDs as in years past (26 last season was his fewest since 2019). Perhaps he'll rebound a bit in that area with the Xavier Worthy/Rashee Rice/Hollywood Brown trio together, but in the meantime Mahomes adds just enough with his legs (between 300 and 400 yards five seasons in a row) to keep him in the fantasy starter conversation.

2025 Outlook:
Mayfield may have enjoyed his career renaissance in 2023, but he had his fantasy breakout in 2024. After finishing 18th or worse in fantasy PPG during each of his first six NFL seasons, Mayfield leapt to fourth in 2024. He finished no lower than fifth in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs, while also easily posting a career high in rush yards. Mayfield completed 71% of his passes (third best) despite missing Chris Godwin and Mike Evans for chunks of the season, and he may be in even better shape in 2025 with Evans back, Godwin hopefully healthy and youngsters Emeka Egbuka and Jalen McMillan also in the mix. Mayfield benefits from a Bucs offense that has scored a league-high 76.6% of its TDs through the air since Todd Bowles became head coach in 2022. With consecutive seasons of good play under his belt, the 30-year-old is well positioned for another solid QB1 fantasy campaign.

2025 Outlook:
Pickens was traded to the Cowboys after spending his first three seasons in Pittsburgh. Perhaps the change of scenery will get him to the next level, as he's thus far been an exciting playmaker but not yet a consistent fantasy option. Pickens handled a career-high 26% target share (15th among WRs) last season, but he missed three games and found the end zone only three times despite seeing 12 end zone targets (12th most). Pickens has finished 37th or worse in fantasy PPG all three seasons while playing a volatile field-stretcher role (top 15 in aDOT all three years). He will certainly benefit from improved QB play (Dak Prescott), but he now has legitimate target competition from CeeDee Lamb. We likely haven't seen Pickens' best work, but there's enough uncertainty here that the 24-year-old should be valued as a midrange WR3.

Odunze is entering his second NFL season with hopes for a leap forward after an uneven rookie campaign. The 2024 No. 9 overall pick was on the field a ton (eighth among WRs in routes) and was busy near the goal line (11th in the NFL with 13 end zone targets), but he ended up 35th or lower at the position in targets, catches, yards and TDs. Odunze had some poor scoring luck (three TDs, 6.7 expected), which was partially to blame for him scoring single-digit fantasy points in 13 of 17 games. There are a lot of mouths to feed in Chicago, but with Caleb Williams entering Year 2 and Ben Johnson now running the offense, Odunze is an extremely logical breakout candidate. He should be one of your favorite midround targets.

2025 Outlook:
Pollard returns for his second season as the Titans' lead back. He was busier than expected in 2024, when he finished eighth among RBs in carries and 10th in targets. He managed to produce his third consecutive season with 1,000-plus rushing yards and 1,300-plus from scrimmage, but didn't get much goal-line work (five carries inside the 5) and was limited to five TDs (one fewer than Tyjae Spears). Pollard reached 19 fantasy points only once (Spears was out that week) and has finished just one season in his career better than 22nd in fantasy PPG (2022 in Dallas). Entering his age-28 season, Pollard is again expected to lead Tennessee's run game, but Spears will be involved once back from injury, especially in passing situations. Pollard is a solid flex.

2025 Outlook:
Montgomery is entering his seventh NFL season, including his third with Detroit. Jahmyr Gibbs' running mate played 13 full games last season, averaging 16.3 touches and 16.5 fantasy points per game. He had one of the highest floors in fantasy, posting at least 12.6 points in all but one of the outings. Montgomery's ceiling will be limited as long as Gibbs is in the mix, but he handles a solid workload as a rusher, including near the goal line (he's finished exactly fourth with 17 carries inside the 5 each of the last two seasons), and he saw a boost in receiving work last season (2.8 targets per game). Montgomery is now 28 years old and could cede a few more touches to Gibbs this season, but he's finished 16th or better in fantasy PPG each of the last two years and is a good bet to remain on the RB2/flex radar again in 2025.

2025 Outlook:
Hockenson is eyeing a bounce-back following a 2024 season in which he missed Weeks 1-7 and was limited a bit upon his return while rebounding from a torn ACL suffered in 2023. Hockenson appeared in 10 regular-season games, but was limited to 60% of the snaps and averaged 6.1 targets and 8.7 fantasy points per game. That's a far cry from his 80% snap share, 8.5 targets per game and 14.6 PPG the season prior. Hockenson entered last season having finished seventh or better among TEs in fantasy PPG four years in a row (top 5 in both 2022 and 2023), so it's reasonable to expect him to return to that level in 2025. New QB J.J. McCarthy is a wild card, but Kevin O'Connell's pass-friendly offense should help keep Hockenson in the weekly TE1 mix.

2025 Outlook:
Jones re-signed with Minnesota after a successful 2024 campaign, in which he appeared in all 17 regular-season games and ranked top 10 among RBs in carries, targets, touches and yards. Jones, who played a career-high 64% of the offensive snaps, was effective as a rusher and receiver but had the league's worst touchdown luck (seven TDs, 12.8 expected), which limited him to a 20th-place finish in fantasy PPG. Scoring regression is a strong bet in 2025, but Jones is now 30 years old, working in a pass-first scheme and will defer work (perhaps substantial work) to newcomer Jordan Mason. Jones should be viewed as a flex option.

2025 Outlook:
Harvey was selected by Denver in the second round of April's draft. He is on the small side (5-foot-8, 205 pounds), but he plays tough and is productive, having run for 10-plus yards on a class-best 23% of his carries last season. Size and age (24) concerns aside, he showed well at the combine, including a 4.40 40, 38-inch vertical and 127-inch broad jump. Harvey's landing spot is very good, as fellow newcomer J.K. Dobbins is his primary competition for work. The duo may split carries, but Harvey is a good bet to emerge as the primary receiving back, which is notable in a Sean Payton offense that often leans heavily on RBs in the passing game. Harvey is a fringe RB2 target, but there's upside for even more.

2025 Outlook:
Pacheco enters 2025 as a tricky evaluation. He emerged as Kansas City's lead back in Week 10 of his rookie season (2022) and proceeded to average 17.6 touches, 86.0 yards, 0.6 TDs and 14.2 fantasy points per game over his next 32 outings, including the playoffs. A broken fibula suffered in Week 2 last season cost him nine games and he wasn't quite the same after that, averaging 8.8 touches and 4.2 fantasy points per game while rotating with Kareem Hunt and Samaje Perine. The 26-year-old has upside if he retakes clear lead-back duties, but that's far from certain with Hunt and Elijah Mitchell in the mix. There's some post-hype appeal here, but Pacheco should be viewed as a midround lottery ticket.

2025 Outlook:
Perhaps the most underrated player in fantasy, Meyers enters 2025 eyeing his fifth consecutive top-30 fantasy campaign. The veteran is one of 10 receivers with 67-plus receptions and 800-plus receiving yards in each of the past four seasons and he peaked with career highs in targets, catches, yards and end zone targets (11) in 2024. The 28-year-old has dealt with shaky QB play in recent seasons, but is in a better spot this season with Geno Smith under center and Pete Carroll coaching the team. Second only to Brock Bowers in target priority, Meyers figures to again push for WR3/flex numbers, but will likely be undervalued on draft day.

2025 Outlook:
Golden was selected by Green Bay in the first round of April's draft. He impressed at the combine with a 4.29 40-yard dash and 1.49 10-yard split (both best among WRs). He's a bit on the small side and his 1.86 YPRR across 36 collegiate games isn't very good, but he did make a big leap in 2024 (his lone year at Texas), posting a 58-987-9 receiving line. He can work all over the formation and is a plus kick returner. With Christian Watson (ACL) likely to miss a big chunk of the season and Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed as his primary competition for work, Golden has a good chance to operate as Jordan Love's top target in 2025. The speedster should be viewed as a WR3 with obvious upside.

2025 Outlook:
Egbuka was selected by Tampa Bay in the first round of April's draft. Whether it's size, age, 40 time or collegiate usage and efficiency, Egbuka falls right in the middle of basically every category relative to the rest of this WR class. The Ohio State product was primarily a slot (73%), short-range (8.6 aDOT) target in college, but was productive, catching 72% of his targets and posting a strong 2.64 YPRR. Also a rushing and return threat, Egbuka will have a role right out of the gate, but just how sizable it is will depend on the health of Chris Godwin (ankle). If Godwin is sidelined (and with Jalen McMillan also injured), Egbuka will be well positioned for a major early-career role that could vault him into the WR3 mix. Once Godwin is back, however, consistent fantasy output may be hard to find. Egbuka is worth a mid-round pick and is a terrific dynasty hold.

2025 Outlook:
Olave is entering his fourth NFL season following a troubling 2024 campaign in which he played only six full games while battling concussion woes. The good news is that Olave appears healthy for 2025 and he's been productive when active throughout his career. That includes 2024, as he produced 80-plus yards four times in those six games. He handled a 24% target share, which wasn't far off his 27% and 25% rates during his first two seasons. The 2022 first-round pick has yet to reach his ceiling (he's yet to clear five TDs in a season), but he produced top-25 fantasy campaigns in his first two seasons and is set up well to pace New Orleans in targets in 2025. Of course, there's added risk here as the Saints turn to rookie QB Tyler Shough and Spencer Rattler following Derek Carr's retirement. Olave is safest as a WR3/flex, with a hint of post-hype sleeper appeal.

Pearsall is entering his second NFL season positioned well for a breakout after a gunshot wound derailed a chunk of his rookie campaign. After debuting in Week 7, Pearsall had a few strong fantasy outings (17-plus points in three games), but was otherwise a nonfactor (3.6 PPG in the other eight games). The 2024 first-round pick finished strong (8-141-1 and 6-69-1 receiving lines in Weeks 17 and 18, respectively) and now has a much clearer path to consistent work with Deebo Samuel Sr. gone and Brandon Aiyuk (ACL) expected to miss part of the season. There are still plenty of mouths to feed in San Francisco, but Pearsall very well could lead this team in targets. He's well worth a midround flier.

Pittman is eyeing a rebound campaign after following up three consecutive top-20 fantasy seasons with a 41st-place finish in 2024. He averaged a healthy 27% target share in 10 full games with Anthony Richardson, but that resulted in an ugly 39-428-0 receiving line on 65 targets. He averaged 8.0 fantasy PPG, reaching double digits once (15.6 in Week 12). Pittman continues to struggle to find the end zone (his career high is six and he's had four or fewer three seasons in a row) and, while that may not have changed with Richardson under center (the Colts had eight pass TDs in his 10 games last season), he'll be in a more fantasy-friendly spot with Daniel Jones winning the Colts' starting gig. Pittman is an underated flex option with WR3 upside.

Diggs' 2024 stint with Houston started well (he had six-plus targets in all eight games and averaged 15.2 fantasy PPG), but ended with a torn ACL in Week 8. He has finished in the top 25 in fantasy PPG nine years in a row (17th or better in eight of them) and, at least in terms of target competition, has a clear path to a gigantic target share in a Patriots' offense led by impressive second-year QB Drake Maye. Of course, Diggs is now 31 years old and it's unclear if he'll be his usual self following the knee injury. A healthy Diggs could rise as high as the WR2 mix, but the uncertainty makes him a logical midround target.

A fifth-round flier in last year's NFL draft, Tracy took over as the Giants' de facto lead back in Week 5 and went on to play 11 "full" games with Devin Singletary also active. During that span, Tracy played 67% of the snaps and handled 13.2 carries and 3.5 targets per game. He reached 65 yards in nine of the 11 games and averaged 12.2 fantasy PPG, which ranked 23rd among RBs. Tracy's efficiency and TD total suffered in New York's struggling offense and, while they figure to improve with better QB play in 2025, he's now likely ticketed for a timeshare with fourth-round rookie Cam Skattebo. The 25-year-old is a fringe flex option.

2025 Outlook:
Warren is entering his fourth NFL season in position for a larger role following the offseason departure of Najee Harris. Warren has thus far been limited to a situational role (11.3 touches per game since the start of 2023), though it hasn't helped that Harris hasn't missed a single game since Warren entered the league. Warren is primarily a passing-game specialist (his 99 receptions ranks seventh among RBs over the past two seasons) but, while he hasn't cleared 149 carries or four TDs in a season, he has run well (4.8 YPC, 2.0 YAC). With rookie Kaleb Johnson likely to play a significant role as a rusher, Warren figures to settle in as a PPR flex.

Croskey-Merritt was selected by Washington in the seventh round after spending six seasons at the collegiate level. After four seasons at Alabama State, he had his breakout season at New Mexico in 2023 prior to appearing in only one game in 2024. Croskey-Merritt is an older back with limited recent playing time, but he posted elite efficiency in 2023 and showed so well during the offseason that Washington shipped lead rusher Brian Robinson Jr. to the 49ers in August. Despite being a late-round pick and the presence of passing-down specialist Austin Ekeler, "Bill" has a legitimate shot to lead Washington's backfield as a rookie, which presents plenty of fantasy appeal. He should be on your radar in the middle rounds.

Kelce is a future Hall of Famer, but his days as an elite fantasy tight end may be over. Kelce's targets and receptions actually increased from 2023 to 2024, but he saw a big dip in yards (823), TDs (three), yards per target (6.1) and RAC (3.5), all of which were career lows. After finishing no lower than third in fantasy points (second in PPG) in eight straight seasons, Kelce fell to fifth (seventh in PPG) in 2024. He will continue to benefit from Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs' pass-heavy offense, but especially with the team's WR upgrades, the 35-year-old is now more of a midrange TE1.

He was a top-10 scorer in seven of 11 games and finished top 5 at the position in targets for the second season in a row. Njoku has rarely been very productive in the scoring department (his career high is six touchdowns), but he found the end zone five times last season and has now led the position in end zone targets two years in a row. Despite Cleveland's never-ending QB issues, Njoku has finished 11th or better in three consecutive fantasy campaigns (top 8 in PPG) and the 29-year-old remains a midrange TE1.

2025 Outlook:
Andrews is a tricky evaluation after an odd career turn in 2024 in which he was fortunate to finish eighth in fantasy PPG after posting top-5 finishes the prior five seasons. After handling a target share in the 22-to-28% range during 2019-23 (all were top 4 at the position), Andrews dipped to 15% in 2024 (20th) and finished 20th in targets, 14th in catches, ninth in yards and first in TDs among tight ends. Andrews has always been extremely efficient when targeted (he's never finished lower than fifth in YPRR), but he's also never been quite as TD dependent (11 TDs in 2024 were a career high and his 16.2% TD rate was way above his prior career rate of 7.1%). Andrews was bailed out by the TD outlier and will need to bounce back in the target area in order to return to elite TE1 production.

Engram signed with Denver after spending his first eight NFL seasons with the Giants and Jaguars. The 2017 first-round pick is coming off a bit of a lost season, as injuries cost him seven games and he found the end zone only once when active. Engram was still heavily targeted (his 25% target share ranked third among TEs) and, even with last season's dud, he has finished top 7 in fantasy PPG in five of his eight seasons. Engram isn't much of a touchdown scorer (he hasn't produced more than four in a season since 2017, but he's joining a good Denver offense led by Sean Payton (who helped Jimmy Graham to three consecutive top-2 fantasy seasons) and impressive second-year QB Bo Nix. Engram remains squarely in the back-end TE1 mix and there's upside for even more.

Nix returns as Denver's starter after an impressive rookie campaign in which he produced 316.2 fantasy points, fifth most by a first-year QB. Nix improved as the season went on. After posting 5.7 YPA and five pass TDs during his first seven games, he leapt to a 7.4 YPA and 24 pass TDs in his final 10 outings. He finished the regular season sixth in pass attempts, completions and pass TDs, as well as fifth among QBs in carries. Nix's dual-threat ability and improved supporting cast (which now includes Evan Engram) have him on the QB1 radar, and there's upside for more.

Murray is back for his seventh NFL season, fresh off a 2024 campaign that may have been his best yet. Murray appeared in every regular-season game for the first time since 2020 and delivered as both a passer (top 13 in attempts, completions, yards and TDs) and rusher (top 8 in carries, yards and TDs). Murray finished 12th among QBs in fantasy PPG, which is actually the <i>worst</i> finish of his career. He completed a career-high 69% of his passes despite a bit of an underwhelming showing from Marvin Harrison Jr. It's fair to expect a leap from Harrison in his second season, so, along with the presence of Trey McBride, Murray has the tools he needs for another mid-to-back-end QB1 fantasy campaign.

2025 Outlook:
The 2024 season was a disappointment for the 49ers, but the good news is that Purdy still played at a high level. The 2022 seventh-round pick finished fifth in QBR and third in YPA after leading the league in both in 2023. Purdy missed two games and saw his passing TDs dip from 30 to 20, but he also took his rushing to a new level with career highs in carries, yards and TDs. By season's end, he was 10th among QBs in fantasy PPG, which was a slight dip from his eighth-place finish in 2023. Purdy has yet to finish a season better than 17th in pass attempts, but that could change in 2025 after several major defensive departures. With Kyle Shanahan calling the shots and a good supporting cast led by George Kittle, Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams, Purdy is positioned well for another fringe-QB1 fantasy season.

2025 Outlook:
Ekeler is returning for his ninth NFL season, including his second in Washington. Ekeler played eight full games with Brian Robinson Jr. last season (including the playoffs), with Ekeler handling 5.5 carries and 4.5 targets per game while playing 51% of the snaps. In those eight games, he wasn't much of a fantasy factor (10.0 PPG, clearing 12.8 once), which can somewhat be traced to a nonexistent role near the goal line (zero TDs or carries inside the 5). With Robinson traded, Ekeler's role may increase slightly this season, but that's not a sure thing with rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt in the fold. Ekeler was productive when Robinson was sidelined last season (3 TDs -- all from the 1-yard line -- and 15.4 PPG), so while he's now 30 years old, he has the look of a low-ceiling flex.

2025 Outlook:
Dobbins signed with Denver in June. After struggling with injuries throughout most of his first four NFL seasons, Dobbins was handed the keys to the Chargers' backfield last season. He ran well (4.6 YPC, 1.9 YAC) but struggled as a receiver (his 3.8 YPT ranked 38th among 39 qualified RBs) and was an inconsistent fantasy producer (15-plus points seven times, but below 11 in the other six games). Dobbins missed four games (he's yet to play a full season), but he still managed 1,058 yards and nine TDs. He's now 26 years old and is expected to team up with second-round rookie RJ Harvey. The two very well could split carries, with Harvey taking the lead in passing situations. Dobbins is unlikely to see quite the volume he enjoyed in Los Angeles, but he'll have a respectable role in an ascending Denver offense. He's a fine mid-to-late-round target.

2025 Outlook:
Stevenson returns for his fifth season in New England, but his role is not as secure as in years past after the team drafted TreVeyon Henderson in the second round and after fumbling issues (RB-high seven) led to a demotion during the 2024 season. Those issues aside, Stevenson was still fairly busy and effective despite New England's shaky offense last season, as he totaled 969 yards (the second most of his career) and a career-high eight TDs. The 27-year-old figures to benefit from the team's coaching change, as all six of Mike Vrabel's Titans offenses were run-heavy. Stevenson may remain the starter in New England, but there's a good chance he'll play a lesser role as the thunder to Henderson's lightning. Stevenson is a fringe flex option with limited upside.

Williams signed with Dallas after an up-and-down four seasons in Denver. The 2021 second-round pick exploded out of the gate with 1,219 yards and seven TDs as a rookie, but was never able to match either number the following three seasons. Sean Payton's scheme helped Williams to 72 targets (fifth most among RBs) last season, but that wasn't enough for Williams to log his first top-25 fantasy campaign on a per-game basis. Perhaps Brian Schottenheimer can reignite Williams' career (Miles Sanders and fifth-round rookie Jaydon Blue are his only competition for touches), but the 25-year-old is unlikely to emerge as anything more than a flex.

2025 Outlook:
Johnson was selected by Pittsburgh in the third round of April's draft. He isn't super-fast (4.57 40-yard dash) or quick (1.62 10-yard split), which limited his output at Iowa (only 34% of runs went for 5-plus yards), but he's one of the biggest backs in this class. He's seemingly a capable receiver, but didn't do it much in college (38 targets) and needs work as a pass blocker, so his fantasy ceiling might be a bit limited. That's especially the case with Jaylen Warren positioned to handle about one-third of the carries and most of the passing-down work. Johnson may eventually emerge as the de facto Najee Harris replacement in run-heavy Pittsburgh, so he's well worth a midround flier, but don't be surprised if he gets off to a slow start.

2025 Outlook:
Skattebo was selected by the Giants in the fourth round of April's draft. He's one of the oldest RBs in this class (23), but that's not enough to offset his elite efficiency during two seasons at Arizona State. Skattebo's 3.1 forced missed tackle rate last season was best in this class (his career rate ranked second), as was his 15% target share and 11.1 yards per target. He's not super-fast, but he has good size and a three-down skill set, which supplies him with a solid long-term fantasy outlook. Of course, Skattebo is likely to split work with impressive sophomore Tyrone Tracy Jr., so his 2025 upside may be limited. He's a fine midround target.

Kupp signed with Seattle after spending his first eight NFL seasons with the division rival Rams. He has been an elite fantasy contributor in years past (he was No. 1 in PPG in both 2021 and 2022), but durability has been an issue (two full seasons in his career and exactly five missed games each of the past two years) and he's now 32 years old. Kupp remained a good fantasy contributor during most of last season (18.4 PPG in his first nine games), but it's concerning how quickly he faded down the stretch (4.9 PPG in his final five outings). Perhaps Kupp has one more big season left, and there are plenty of targets available opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba, but there is certainly risk here. He's best viewed as a flex.

2025 Outlook:
Addison returns for Year 3 in Minnesota having finished 23rd and 21st, respectively, in fantasy PPG during his first two NFL campaigns. Addison has been a TD machine, scoring 10 times in both seasons, which has helped offset underwhelming volume. He finished both seasons 25th or lower among WRs in targets, receptions and yards, as well as 40th or lower in target share. That led to boom/bust production last season, as he scored 43% of his fantasy points in three games and was held to single digits in seven of 15 outings. Addison is suspended three games to begin the 2025 season, but once he's on the field, he will continue battling for looks with Justin Jefferson and T.J. Hockenson. His late-season target surge (eight-plus in seven of his final eight games) provides optimism that he can sustain WR3 numbers, especially in Kevin O'Connell's pass-friendly scheme.

2025 Outlook:
After three seasons playing a depth role, Jennings enjoyed a breakout in 2024. The 2020 seventh-round pick soaked up a 25% target share en route to a top-30 finish among WRs in targets, catches, yards, TDs, end zone targets and fantasy points (27th in PPG). His 46.5-point effort in Week 3 was the third-highest total posted in a single week last season. Jennings' usage benefited from injuries above him on the depth chart, but with Deebo Samuel Sr. gone and Brandon Aiyuk expected to miss roughly half the season, he's again ticketed for a big role in 2025. Jennings, who ranked 11th among WRs in yards per route run, is a viable flex target, though a slow start is possible after he missed significant chunk of offseason activities.

2025 Outlook:
Samuel was traded to the Commanders after spending his first six pro seasons with the 49ers. One of the league's most versatile offensive players, Samuel has 50-plus catches and 37-plus carries in each of the past four seasons. The fantasy output has been volatile, however, as he was a top-12 in PPG in 2021 and 2023, but outside the top 25 the other four seasons. Durability has been an issue, as he's yet to play a full regular season. With Terry McLaurin as his only notable target competition, Samuel has a path to similar usage to what he saw in San Francisco. That should allow starting-caliber fantasy production, but the high likelihood of missed action pushes him down to a midround draft-day target.

2025 Outlook:
After two years in a situational role, Shakir emerged as Josh Allen's top target in 2024. The results were good in reality -- he caught 77% of his targets and was elite with the ball in his hands (7.9 RAC), both of which ranked fourth among WRs -- but not as much in fantasy. Shakir finished 35th in fantasy PPG and had little upside (his best weekly finish was 10th). He handled a 23% target share (an appealing number in a great offense), but most of it is in the short area (29% of his targets were screens) and he simply doesn't get much run near the goal line (seven career TDs and five career end zone targets). The 25-year-old's role drastically limits his ceiling and, especially with Keon Coleman and perhaps Dalton Kincaid ticketed for a leap forward, Shakir is best valued as a flex.

2025 Outlook:
Coleman is eyeing a Year 2 leap following an uneven rookie campaign in which the second-round pick was limited to 57 targets in 13 regular-season games. Coleman was on the field quite a bit (73% snap share) and started to pick up steam around midseason (consecutive games with at least seven targets and 16 fantasy points), but a wrist injury then cost him four games and he went without a 12-point outing from that point forward (including three playoff games). Coleman's role as a vertical target (his 15.0 aDOT ranked fifth) allowed him many big plays (his 19.2 YPR ranked third), but major volatility (51% catch rate). Coleman was a young rookie at age 21 and showed enough flashes to suggest a Year 2 breakout is possible, especially in a Josh Allen-led offense with Khalil Shakir and Joshua Palmer as his top competition. Coleman is well worth a mid-to-late-round pick.

2025 Outlook:
Godwin has had some big seasons during his eight years in the league, but he was well on his way to his best one yet in 2024 prior to suffering a season-ending ankle injury in Week 7. In his seven games, the veteran receiver averaged 19.7 fantasy PPG and caught 79% of his passes, both of which ranked second at the position. Perhaps most notably, Godwin scored five TDs in seven games, which was somewhat unsustainable (2.1 xTD) but nonetheless a step forward after he totaled 10 TDs the prior three seasons (46 games). Godwin is still in his prime at age 29 and now seemingly Baker Mayfield's top target, but he's going to miss games to open the season. Once back, he's well positioned for a big comeback season and could rise as high as WR1 territory. He's best valued as a midround lottery ticket.

Herbert is entering his sixth NFL season following a solid but unspectacular fantasy campaign in 2024. Playing in Jim Harbaugh's and Greg Roman's slow-paced, balanced offense (as opposed to pass-heavy schemes of prior years), Herbert finished no better than ninth among QBs in pass attempts, pass yards, pass TDs, carries and rush yards. Herbert has now finished just outside the top 10 in fantasy PPG three seasons in a row, though he did improve in the second half of last season (24th during Weeks 1-7, but 10th in Weeks 8-18). Herbert's skill level, solid supporting cast and moderate rushing contributions are just enough to keep him in the fringe QB1 mix, but his ceiling is lower than in years past.

2025 Outlook:
Williams is entering his second NFL season with hopes for a leap forward under new head coach and playcaller Ben Johnson. The 2024 No. 1 pick had a few big games (22-plus fantasy points five times), but way too many major duds (nine games with fewer than 12 points) during his first season. Efficiency was an issue (outside of the top 35 in QBR, YPA and completion %) and he took a league-high 68 sacks, but he got experience (QB2 in dropbacks), avoided INTs (seven) and added value with his legs (seventh at QB in carries, rush yards and YPC). With Johnson designing the offense, a much-improved interior offensive line and a good supporting cast led by DJ Moore, Rome Odunze, Colston Loveland and Luther Burden III, Williams has no excuses as he enters a critical Year 2. He's safest when drafted as a fringe QB1, but he has a very high ceiling.

Maye is entering his second NFL season and his first as the Patriots' Week 1 starter. The 2024 third overall pick took over as New England's starter in Week 6 and went on to play the bulk of the snaps in 10 games. Though he wasn't a starting option in fantasy (his one top-10 outing came in Week 7), he played well (17th in QBR) and provided a respectable floor, averaging 16.4 fantasy PPG (that would've ranked 15th over the full season). New coach Mike Vrabel operated run-heavy offenses all six seasons in Tennessee, which may limit Maye's upside, but that could mostly be offset by Maye's rushing ability (he ranked ninth in yards, second in YPC and fifth in scrambles among QBs as a rookie). Especially if Stefon Diggs (ACL) will be ready to go in Week 1, Maye will make for an excellent late-round flier with upside.

Prescott returns for his age-32 campaign following a disappointing and injury-shortened 2024. In eight games, Prescott totaled 11 TDs and eight INTs through the air and wasn't much of a factor with his legs (career-low 54 yards). He averaged 14.6 fantasy PPG (16.8 in the six games he played in full), which was a far cry from the 20.2 (fifth highest) he averaged in 2023. Prescott has now missed multiple games in three of the past five seasons, though he has also been a top-8 fantasy QB (PPG) three times during the span. Adding George Pickens to a supporting cast that also includes CeeDee Lamb and Jake Ferguson is helpful, but because of the concerning dip in rushing, the 10-year vet is best viewed as fringe QB1.

2025 Outlook:
A third-round pick in 2023, Downs has emerged as a quality short-range/slot target, but that has yet to allow consistent fantasy output. The Colts' QB play has been an issue, as in seven full games with Anthony Richardson, Downs averaged 5.9 targets and 10.7 fantasy points per game, but in seven outings with Joe Flacco, he averaged 9.4 targets and 15.5 PPG. Downs, same as other Colts receivers, has struggled to produce with Richardson under center and it's no sure bet he'll be better if Daniel Jones wins the job. Downs is a good player, so he's worth late-round consideration, but the team's QB uncertainty will make him tough to plug into your lineup.

Reed is entering his third NFL season, having produced at least 79 touches, 956 yards and seven TDs during each of his first two seasons in Green Bay. Despite the solid numbers, Reed has yet to emerge as a consistent fantasy producer. He came out hot with a pair of 27-plus-point games during Weeks 1-4 last season, but averaged 9.2 PPG the rest of the season, with zero 20-point efforts. Reed has struggled with drops (eight last season), but he's otherwise been productive (11.4 YPT last season ranked third at WR) and he's also a plus contributor as a rusher (282 yards and three TDs on 31 career carries). Perhaps Reed will make a Year 3 leap, but he's yet to deliver a top-25 fantasy season (PPG) after his 40th-place finish in 2024 and now has to compete with rookies Matthew Golden and Savion Williams for work. He has the look of a low-ceiling flex.

During that 2024 campaign, Allen handled a hefty 26.9% target share (7.9 per game), which ranked 11th among receivers, during 15 active weeks. His efficiency took a big hit from his Los Angeles years (most Chicago pass catchers had this issue), but he did find the end zone seven times and has now scored between six and eight TDs in seven of his last eight seasons. Allen is now 33-years-old (ancient for an NFL receiver) and hasn't played a full regular season since 2019. He's no longer a fantasy WR1 (he finished 34th in PPG last season), but he has a real shot to trail only Ladd McConkey in targets in a solid Los Angeles offense. Allen is a fine late-round flier for your bench and has WR3/flex upside.

2025 Outlook:
Mooney is entering his sixth NFL season, including his second with the Falcons. Year 1 in Atlanta was a relative success despite Mooney playing behind Drake London in a run-heavy offense. The veteran receiver handled a 21% target share and had his best showings in targets, catches and yards since his breakout 2021 season. He also caught a career-high five touchdowns. Though Mooney played well, the production wasn't enough to allow his first top-30 fantasy campaign (PPG). Mooney remains locked into the No. 2 WR role in a Falcons' offense that very well could make a leap with Michael Penix Jr. entering his first season as the full-time starting quarterback. That's enough to put him on the flex radar, but his upside is limited.

2025 Outlook:
Shaheed enters his fourth NFL season as a bit of a tricky evaluation after he was in the midst of a breakout 2024 campaign prior to suffering a season-ending knee injury in Week 6. Arguably the team's No. 1 WR to that point, Shaheed paced the Saints in targets (6.8 per game) and had also produced 29 yards on six carries. His 13.3 fantasy PPG ranked 34th among WRs and he hit the 15-point mark in four of his six games. One of the game's top deep threats and a contributor as a rusher and returner, Shaheed very well could find his way to weekly fantasy relevance in a similar way as Deebo Samuel Sr., albeit with more vertical work. Of course, he's yet to show that level of production over a full season and he'll need to fend off Chris Olave, Alvin Kamara and now Brandin Cooks for work in an offense that will have Spencer Rattler and/or rookie QB Tyler Shough under center. Shaheed is a fine late-round lottery ticket.

2025 Outlook:
Legette is eyeing a second-year leap following a rookie campaign with mixed results. The 2024 first-round pick posted a route participation of at least 59% in 11 games in his first season. He handled a healthy 21% of the targets (6.4 per game) and 30% of the team's air yards, but was limited to 39.3 yards and 9.8 fantasy points per game, reaching 14 points only once. Legette was near the basement of the position in YPR, YPT, YPRR and RAC. Legette is positioned for an every-down role and there are plenty of targets available behind first-round pick Tetairoa McMillan after Adam Thielen was traded to Minnesota. With Legette's pedigree and after Bryce Young's strong finish to 2024, the 24-year-old is well worth a late flier.

2025 Outlook:
Warren was selected by the Colts in the first round of April's draft. Much like Brock Bowers one year ago, Warren is an elite tight end prospect who could eventually emerge as one of the best in the game. He handled a 32% target share at Penn State last season, which allowed a 104-1,233-8 receiving line in 16 games. His 2.84 YPRR was second best in this TE class, and he added 26-218-4 as a rusher. He has the size, athleticism and receiving ability to post top-end numbers, though his stats could be limited in the short term as he works in a Colts offense that is unfriendly to pass catchers due to uncertainty at quarterback. Warren is a terrific dynasty hold, but is best viewed as a mid-to-late-round lottery ticket in 2025 drafts.

Mason was traded to Minnesota and is expected to operate in a committee with Aaron Jones. The 2022 UDFA was terrific in limited work during his three seasons in San Francisco. His 5.31 YPC ranks fourth and his 2.49 YAC is the best among RBs with 200-plus carries since he entered the league. Mason is 26 years old with 250 career touches and is a nonfactor as a receiver (career 14-121-0 line on 18 targets), but he should push for roughly half of Minnesota's carries, with Jones handling the passing-down work. Mason doesn't figure to provide standalone fantasy value and is best valued as an insurance hold for your bench.

2025 Outlook:
Etienne enters his first contract year with eyes on a bounce-back following a rough 2024. After clearing 1,400 yards in both 2022 and 2023 (finishing third among RBs in touches and fantasy points in the latter), Etienne plummeted to career-low marks in touches, yards and TDs last season. After finding the end zone in Weeks 1 and 2, he went without a TD or a fantasy point total above 14.8 the rest of the season. He's still in his prime at age 26, but Etienne's efficiency has been weak two seasons in a row and he's no longer a lock for lead-back duties, with Tank Bigsby ticketed for a big role and fourth-round rookie Bhayshul Tuten now in the mix. Perhaps new coach Liam Coen can get things turned around, but Etienne is best viewed as a bench flier.

2025 Outlook:
Bigsby was promoted to a larger role in 2024 -- his second NFL season -- and he took advantage. The 2023 third-round pick led the NFL in YAC (2.69) and progressively chipped away at Travis Etienne Jr.'s workload as the season progressed. Once he returned from injury in Week 13, Bigsby out-carried Etienne (73-68), but he trailed in snaps (205-149), routes (98-57) and targets (22-7). Bigsby scored three TDs to Etienne's zero, but averaged only 7.8 fantasy PPG due to major receiving limitations (18 yards on seven targets during the span). This committee now includes rookie Bhayshul Tuten and is setting up to be a fantasy nightmare, though perhaps new coach Liam Coen can make some magic happen, as he did with Bucky Irving and Rachaad White in Tampa Bay last season. Bigsby is a bench option with more value in non-PPR.

2025 Outlook:
Tuten was selected by Jacksonville in the fourth round of April's draft. He struggled with negative runs (22%) and fumbles (class-high 2.5% rate) during his 24 games at Virginia Tech, but his efficiency was elite, as he ranked third in both YAC and forced missed tackle rate. He dominated the combine, posting RB-best marks in the 40 (4.32), speed score (118) and vertical (40.5). Tuten is fast, tough and has three-down ability, though his Year 1 opportunity is unclear with Travis Etienne Jr. and Tank Bigsby also on the depth chart. That could lead to a limited early-season role, but the uncertainty also allows him a chance to steal lead-back duties. Tuten is well worth a late pick, as he could eventually work his way into the RB2 discussion.

Charbonnet is entering his third NFL season and is expected to remain the primary backup to Kenneth Walker III. Charbonnet got some run as Seattle's lead back last season and showed well. In the six games Walker missed, he averaged 18.3 touches and 19.2 fantasy points per game. Despite the success, Charbonnet was the clear No. 2 the 11 weeks Walker played, averaging 6.1 touches (10 max) and 6.5 fantasy points (12.1 max). Charbonnet is a young (24), high-pedigree (second-round) back who has played well, so perhaps new OC Klint Kubiak will give him more run. It is best to treat him as an elite insurance bench hold.

2025 Outlook:
Chubb signed with the Texans during the offseason. Once one of the league's best rushers, Chubb has been riddled by injuries over the past two seasons. He missed all but two games in 2023 due to a major knee injury and, after returning for eight games in 2024, a broken foot cost him the final three games of the season. Chubb was not his usual, elite self when active last season, averaging 3.3 yards per carry while playing only 40% of Cleveland's offensive snaps. Now more than a year removed from the knee injury, perhaps Chubb can get back on track in 2025, but that will be a tough road at age 29 and without much contribution as a receiver. Joe Mixon will miss, at least, four games to open 2025, so Chubb has a shot at flex value during that team. He's worth a late flier.

2025 Outlook:
Ford returns for his fourth season in Cleveland with some uncertainty. He played six full games without Nick Chubb last season and was productive, averaging 14.0 touches, 78.0 yards and 14.0 fantasy points. He was also the team's lead back for most of 2023 and finished 16th among RBs in fantasy points (25th in PPG) while piling up 1,132 yards and nine TDs. Ford, who averaged a terrific 5.4 YPC last season, is capable as a rusher and receiver, and, with rookie Quinshon Judkins dealing with an off-field arrest, could the early portion of 2025 as the Browns' lead back. That would make Ford a viable RB2/flex, assuming he can fend off fourth-round rookie Dylan Sampson.

2025 Outlook:
Fields signed with the Jets and is expected to spend 2025 as the team's starter. Fields spent the first six games of 2024 as the Steelers' starter and, while his play wasn't good enough to avoid a benching in favor of Russell Wilson, the fantasy results were solid; he averaged 18.9 fantasy PPG during his six starts, which would've ranked eighth over the full season. He threw for only 1,106 yards and five TDs, but made up ground as a rusher, ranking top 5 among QBs in carries, rush yards and rush TDs (QB-best five) during Weeks 1-6. This was after he finished his first three NFL seasons top 5 at the position in rushing yards despite missing games each season. Fields' dual-threat ability and a solid group of targets in Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall will be enough to keep him in the weekly QB1 mix.

2025 Outlook:
Love is entering his third season as Green Bay's starter. The 2020 first-round pick played well last season (sixth in QBR) despite battling injury issues, but he wasn't much of a fantasy option. He came out strong with a pair of top-3 fantasy outings in his first four games, but had no additional weekly finishes better than 10th for the season. Love was a nonfactor with his legs (83 rushing yards in 15 games) and, after totaling 15 pass TDs in his first five games, threw only 10 in his final 10 outings. Green Bay did score an unusually high percentage of its offensive TDs on the ground (46%, the second highest for a Matt LaFleur offense), but that may not change with Josh Jacobs back in 2025. Love ran more in 2023 and was a solid fantasy starter, so, especially with a better supporting cast led by first-round WR Matthew Golden, there's hope for a rebound, but it is safer to view him as a QB2.

McCarthy is entering his de facto rookie campaign after a knee injury cost the 2024 10th overall pick his entire first season in the pros. McCarthy is expected to start in a QB-friendly Kevin O'Connell scheme loaded with targets (Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson) that helped Sam Darnold and Kirk Cousins to top-12 fantasy campaigns (PPG) during each of O'Connell's three seasons in Minnesota. All three offenses were pass-heavy and scored at least 80% of their TDs through the air. A 22-year-old with no NFL experience, McCarthy is an obvious unknown, but he can add some value with his legs and is well positioned for a productive first season. He's an attractive late-round sleeper target.

Stroud enters his third NFL season looking for a rebound following a bit of a step back in 2024. Stroud had one of the best seasons ever by a rookie QB in 2023 (12th in QBR, eighth in pass yards, ninth in fantasy PPG), but he plummeted to 26th in QBR, 14th in pass yards and 28th in PPG last season. He opened the season with two seventh-place fantasy weeks in his first four games, but proceeded to finish 14th or worse each of the 13 remaining weeks. He reached 20 fantasy points only once (Week 4). Still only 23, Stroud is still on the ascent, but he'll need to produce more through the air in order to offset mild-to-moderate rushing contributions. He's best viewed as a serviceable QB2 with limited upside.

When active last season, he handled 37% of Michigan's targets and a class-high 40% of the air yards. Only 21 years old, Loveland is one of the youngest players entering the league, but he figures to play a sizable offensive role right out of the gate. Chicago is strong at wide receiver and Cole Kmet remains on the roster, but Loveland should see enough work in Ben Johnson's offensive to allow (at least) fringe TE1 production.

In the 27 games since (including the playoffs), Kraft averaged 4.3 targets and 9.4 fantasy points per game. He played 85% of Green Bay's offensive snaps in 2024 and while his volume was underwhelming (18th among TEs in targets and receptions), he was productive (seventh in yards and fourth in touchdowns). Kraft finished second at the position in yards per reception and yards per target, as well as first in RAC for the second season in a row. Kraft finished 15th in fantasy PPG and he'll need additional volume in 2025 in order to leap into the weekly TE1 mix. The 24-year-old has some upside, but he's safest as a good TE2.

He's otherwise been productive (top 10 in YPRR five of the past six seasons) and, whether he stays put or is traded, he'll surely remain a consistent piece of the passing game. Goedert should be valued as a good TE2.

Ferguson enters 2025 with eyes on a rebound after he fell from 10th in fantasy PPG in 2023 to 23rd last season. He essentially missed four full games, but still finished ninth among TEs in targets. The main issue was touchdowns, as he fell from five scores and a position-high 10 end zone targets in 2023 to zero TDs and two end zone targets in 2024. His 88 targets were easily the most among all players without a TD catch. Having Dak Prescott back will help, as Ferguson averaged 10.2 fantasy PPG in seven games with Prescott (not far off his 10.4 PPG in 2023), compared to 5.2 PPG in six full games when he was out. Ferguson is a solid TE2 who could flirt with weekly top-12 numbers.

Kincaid got seven-plus targets in six of 13 regular-season games, but never cleared 53 yards in a single outing and found the end zone only twice. He finished 15th at tight end in targets despite four missed games, but was 26th in catches and 28th in yards thanks to an ugly 59% catch rate and 6.0 YPT. Kincaid's pedigree (2023 first-rounder), heavy usage and the strong Buffalo offense provide hope for a Year 3 leap, but he's risky after such an underwhelming 2024. Consider him a fringe TE1.

Benson is entering his second season after playing a minimal role as a rookie. The 2024 third-round pick never truly pushed James Conner for work and instead was limited to 69 touches in 13 games while sharing change-of-pace duties with Emari Demercado. Benson was effective (4.6 YPC, 2.1 YAC), and though it's logical to expect a larger role in his second season, Conner remains the team's lead back after signing an extension in November. Benson won't have standalone value early on, but he's an intriguing insurance target considering Conner is entering his age-30 season having never played a full regular season.

2025 Outlook:
White enters his fourth NFL season no longer positioned as Tampa Bay's lead back. The 2022 third-round pick peaked when he finished top 5 among RBs in snaps, touches, carries, routes, catches, yards and fantasy points during a breakout 2023 season, but his pedestrian efficiency led to a reduced role in 2024. White still scored nine TDs and ended up in the top 10 among RBs in targets, catches and receiving yards, but he fell to 23rd in fantasy PPG. One of only two backs with 50-plus receptions in each of the past three seasons (Alvin Kamara is the other), White figures to sustain a pass-catching role in a good offense, but Bucky Irving appears to be the new lead back in Tampa. White is a fine late-round insurance flier.

2025 Outlook:
Blue was selected by Dallas in the fifth round of April's draft. Blue's workload was limited in crowded Texas RB rooms (214 carries in three years), but he was an effective rusher (his 3.83 career YAC is fifth best in this class) and he showed his receiving chops with a 42-368-6 receiving line in 2024. He's a bit on the small side (196 pounds) and has had fumble issues, but ran a strong 4.38 40 at the combine. Blue may open his career behind veterans Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders, but neither have played well in recent seasons so this depth chart is wide open. Blue will be on the RB2/flex radar if he wins the lead-back job, so he should be on your radar in the late rounds.

2025 Outlook:
Allgeier is entering his fourth NFL season, including his third straight as Bijan Robinson's backup/running mate. With Robinson taking on a larger role in 2024, Allgeier hit career-low marks in snap share (28%), carries (137) and targets (13). He cleared 12 touches only once (an 18-point win in Week 6), which was also his only game with more than 12.3 fantasy points. The 25-year-old clearly has no standalone fantasy value and, though he's limited as a pass catcher, he'd certainly be positioned for a hefty chunk of Atlanta's carries in the event of a Robinson injury. Allgeier is a fine late-round insurance flier.

2025 Outlook:
Allen is back for Year 2 in New York after soaking up 111 touches as a rookie. The 2024 fourth-round pick quickly stepped into a change-of-pace role behind Breece Hall and was utilized as both a rusher (5.4 carries per game) and receiver (1.7 targets per game). His efficiency wasn't overly impressive (3.6 YPC, 5.1 YPT) and he eventually deferred some work to 2024 fifth-rounder Isaiah Davis, but it's notable that he's still one of the league's youngest backs at 21-years-old. Despite speculation of a committee approach, Hall figures to remain the lead, or at least �1A' back this season, with Allen and Davis battling for the rest of the touches. That won't be enough for consistent fantasy output. Allen is only worth a late pick in deep leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Harris signed with the Chargers after spending his first four seasons in Pittsburgh. He is as durable as they come, as he's the only tailback who has appeared in 100% of his team's games over the past four seasons. He has yet to finish a season lower than seventh in the league in carries (255-plus each season), but that figures to change this season with first-round rookie Omarion Hampton likely to handle lead-back duties in Los Angeles. Harris also figures to be very limited as a receiver, as Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman have a long history of low RB usage in the pass game, in addition to the fact Harris has finished outside the top 20 RBs in targets each of the past two seasons. Harris has ranked in the 20-to-30 range in fantasy PPG each of the past three seasons, but even if he splits carries with Hampton, he'll be hard-pressed to produce consistent flex numbers.

Tillman is entering his third NFL season after what appeared to be a breakout 2024 campaign was derailed by a Week 12 season-ending concussion. The 2023 third-round pick wasn't much of a factor during his first 20 NFL games, but that changed when Amari Cooper was traded prior to Week 7 last season. Over the next four weeks, Tillman would average 9.8 targets (eight-plus in all four) and 18.6 fantasy points (three with 18-plus points). His season ended the following week, but was enough to provide optimism about his future. Cleveland's QB situation is uncertain, but Tillman has a lock on No. 2 duties opposite Jerry Jeudy. Consider the 25-year-old in the late rounds.

2025 Outlook:
Brown re-signed with the Chiefs after a lost 2024 in which he appeared in only five games (including the playoffs). It didn't take long for Brown to play a significant role (he had a season-high eight targets in his debut), but he didn't make much noise, maxing out at 46 yards and 9.5 fantasy points. Brown has now missed game action in five of his six NFL seasons, including three or more games in three straight years. He has yet to produce a top-20 fantasy campaign in six tries and his lone top-35 finish came in 2021. Kansas City's wide receiver room is suddenly a bit crowded on paper and Brown may find his way to an every-down role only during Rashee Rice's six-game suspension. The 28-year-old Brown is best valued as bench option in deeper leagues, though he'll have WR3/flex appeal while Rice is out.

2025 Outlook:
Higgins was selected by Houston in the second round of April's draft. He is one of the biggest receivers in this class at 6-foot-4, 214 pounds with an 80-inch wingspan. He tested well athletically at the combine and his 2.86 career YPRR ranked third best in this WR class. He handled a big-time target share at Iowa State and was a machine at converting catches into first downs (class-best 74% rate). With Tank Dell a long shot to play in 2025, Higgins will compete with Christian Kirk, Xavier Hutchinson and fellow rookie Jaylin Noel for No. 2 duties opposite Nico Collins. Flex production is possible if he wins that gig, but a lot has to go right. He's best viewed as a late-round lottery ticket.

2025 Outlook:
Robinson is entering his fourth NFL season following a breakout 2024 campaign. The 2022 second-round pick was limited to 838 yards and three TDs on 94 touches during his first two seasons (21 games), but made the leap to 717 yards and three TDs on 96 touches in 17 games while playing alongside Malik Nabers in 2024. Despite handling a hefty 25% target share (which helped him to top-10 finishes in both targets and receptions), Robinson finished outside the top 40 receivers in yardage and fantasy PPG due to a WR-low 4.9 aDOT and horrific 5.0 YPT. The 24-year-old is strictly a short-area option and, though having Russell Wilson (and perhaps Jaxson Dart) under center will help, Robinson is a very low-ceiling PPR depth receiver.

Mims is entering his third NFL season with breakout potential after a red-hot finish to 2024. After barely seeing work his first year and a half in the league (1.6 touches per game), the 2023 second-round pick handled 12 carries and 37 targets during Weeks 10-18 (eight games). He scored six TDs and averaged 13.0 fantasy PPG, which included three games with 19-plus points in his final five outings. On the negative side, Mims remained a part-time player during his heater, failing to play more than 48% of the offensive snaps in any game prior to hitting a career-high 69% in the playoff loss to Buffalo. With Courtland Sutton the only receiver clearly ahead of him on the depth chart in Denver, Mims is positioned for a Year 3 leap. He's a fine late-round lottery ticket.

2025 Outlook:
Henry is entering his fifth season in New England fresh off a career year in most categories. He set career-best marks in target share (20%), targets, catches and receiving yards, but still finished 16th in fantasy PPG due to a lack of TDs. Henry found the end zone only twice, which matches a career low. The veteran tight end hasn't finished a season better than 15th in PPG since 2020 (his final season with the Chargers) and though he was better with Drake Maye on the field, he'll now need to overcome more target competition with Stefon Diggs and rookie Kyle Williams in the lineup. Henry, 30, is likely to post midrange TE2 numbers, but there's a shot for more if Maye makes a big Year 2 leap.

2025 Outlook:
We're now four years into the Kyle Pitts experience and it's safe to say things aren't going as well as expected. The 2021 No. 4 overall pick exploded out of the gate with 1,026 yards and an 11th-place finish in fantasy PPG as a 20-year-old rookie, but he's yet to come close to those marks since, peaking at 667 yards and 17th in PPG (both in 2023). Pitts did post career highs in TDs (four) and end zone targets (seven) last season, but his 14% target share was a career low and ranked 25th among TEs. He wasn't even playing half the snaps during the final month of the season, leaving his role very much in question for 2025. He has the pedigree and is still only 24 years old, but Pitts can't be trusted as anything more than a bench lottery ticket.

2025 Outlook:
Goff makes for a tricky evaluation in his 10th NFL season, as his seventh-place showing in fantasy PPG in 2024 was the first time he ever finished better than 10th. With Ben Johnson leading the offense, Goff has finished sixth or better in passing yards and TDs each of the last three seasons, but he adds almost nothing with his legs (150 yards and two TDs total during the three seasons). Even during a productive 2024, Goff was inconsistent, as he posted eight top-10 fantasy weeks but was 17th or worse the other nine weeks. Especially with Johnson off to Chicago, Goff is likely to see some regression in key efficiency categories (his 72% completion rate and 8.6 YPA last season were way above his previous career highs) and, coupled with his lack of rushing, he has a very low fantasy ceiling. Goff will remain a productive passer, but he's no more than a QB2 with occasional streaming appeal.

2025 Outlook:
Tagovailoa returns as the starter in Miami. With the Dolphins seeing two-high safeties on a league-high 56% of pass plays, he went super-conservative, posting a league-low 5.7 aDOT and completing a league-best 73% of his passes. He had a midseason stretch of four straight top-10 fantasy outings, but otherwise had one weekly finish better than 17th (eighth in Week 1). During the 11 weeks he was active, Tagovailoa averaged 16.5 fantasy PPG (14th best). He remains a nonfactor with his legs (below 75 yards three straight seasons, with zero rush TDs during the span), which is why he's never finished a season better than 10th in fantasy PPG. A decent supporting cast led by Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and De'Von Achane keeps Tagovailoa in the weekly streaming mix, but he has a low ceiling due to the limited rushing output.

Stafford returns for his fifth season in Los Angeles. The 37-year-old continues to play good football (11th in QBR last season), but that hasn't translated to much fantasy success (27th in fantasy PPG last season and his last top-10 season was with Detroit in 2019). Stafford has finished each of the last two seasons just outside the top 10 in attempts, completions, pass yards and pass TDs, while also continuing to offer almost zero with his legs (39.5 rushing yards per season and one total rush TD since joining the Rams). A solid line and elite Puka Nacua/Davante Adams WR duo could help boost Stafford's passing numbers in 2025, but the lack of rushing will limit him to nothing more than a bye-week streamer.

2025 Outlook:
Sampson was selected by Cleveland in the fourth round of April's draft. He is one of the smallest and youngest RBs (20) in this class. He was an effective collegiate rusher (5.9 YPC), but wasn't used much in the pass game (1.5 targets per game). He's tough and makes plays, but his size could limit his touch ceiling. Sampson's fantasy outlook is less than ideal, as second-round rookie Quinshon Judkins is the team's short- and long-term lead back, with Jerome Ford possibly a factor in 2025 as well. Sampson is barely worth late-round consideration, but is a fine dynasty hold.

2025 Outlook:
Judkins was selected by Cleveland in the second round of April's draft. He is a big, tough runner who showed well at the combine, including an RB-best 132-inch broad jump and a 4.48 40 at 221 pounds. He figures to be busy near the goal line in the pros, as he was in college (16-plus TDs in all three seasons). He can catch the ball a bit, but wasn't overly impressive in that area at Ole Miss and Ohio State. Judkins figures to eventually step in as Cleveland's lead back, though he may defer some work to Jerome Ford and fellow rookie Dylan Sampson, especially as he deals with the ramifications of a July arrest. Once fully integrated into the offense, Judkins will be a solid bet for weekly RB2 fantasy production, but the off-field trouble may lead to little-to-no early season work.

2025 Outlook:
Mixon is back with Houston following a relatively successful debut campaign with the team, however he'll miss, at least, the first four games of the 2025 season due to injury. In 2024, Mixon also struggled with injuries, missing three games and leaving several early, but he was a heavily utilized force when active. During the 15 games he played at least 40% of the snaps (including the playoffs), Mixon averaged 21.4 touches, 101.1 yards and 18.1 fantasy points per game, scoring 14 TDs during the span. Mixon carries some risk as a 29-year-old back with 2,313 career touches and, though he has added competition in the form of Nick Chubb and rookie Woody Marks, he still has a path to substantial work as both a rusher and receiver, once healthy. Mixon's injury means he's only worth a late flier, but if he returns to action, he can find his way back to the RB2 mix.

2025 Outlook:
Davis is entering his second season after soaking up 130 touches as a rookie last season. The fourth-round pick essentially split change-of-pace duties with Ty Johnson behind lead back James Cook. Davis played 24% of the snaps on the season and averaged 7.6 touches per game. He cleared 12 touches only twice (Cook was out or limited for both) and was impressive (152 yards in Week 6, 65 yards and one TD in Week 18). The 25-year-old was effective as both a rusher and receiver and, as we saw in a small sample last season, he'd likely be Buffalo's lead back (with Johnson also plenty involved) in the event of a Cook injury. That makes him a valuable insurance back worth consideration in the late rounds.

2025 Outlook:
Shipley is entering his second NFL season in position to earn the primary backup role behind Saquon Barkley. With Barkley dominating the touches and Kenneth Gainwell second in line for work, the 2024 fourth-round pick was limited to 34 touches in 16 games as a rookie, 14 of which came with the starters resting in Week 18. Granted it was a small sample, but Shipley wasn't overly effective (2.7 YPC), which aligns with his underwhelming collegiate efficiency. Still, with Gainwell now in Pittsburgh, Shipley has an opportunity to lock down one of the league's best insurance jobs. Should Barkley miss time, the 23-year-old would likely see enough work behind an elite line in a high-scoring offense to allow RB2/flex production. Shipley makes for a fine late-round dart throw.

Gordon was selected by Miami in the sixth round of April's draft. He is one of the largest RBs in this class (6-foot-1 and 226 pounds, with a class-high 80-inch wingspan). He had a rough 2024 in tough circumstances (4.63 YPC, third worst in this class), but was much better as a rusher and receiver during a productive 2023 campaign. He's not super-fast or dynamic, but he's young and a solid producer. Gordon will battle Jaylen Wright for No. 2 duties. He's a name to watch, but is a long shot for 2025 fantasy production barring an injury to De'Von Achane.

2025 Outlook:
Bateman is entering his fifth season (all with Baltimore) following a big leap forward in 2024. Bateman appeared in all 17 regular season games for the first time and, though his 15.4% target share was the second lowest of his career, he posted career-best marks in yardage, touchdowns and fantasy points. Targets remained inconsistent, however, and led to extremely boom/bust production (eight single-digit fantasy point games and a 47th-place finish in PPG, the latter of which is a career best). The 25-year-old is a capable situational deep threat (he's ranked top 12 in aDOT two years in a row), but he's a good bet for touchdown regression to the mean (4.6 expected TDs last season) and his usage is too volatile to allow weekly flex consideration.

2025 Outlook:
Douglas is entering his third NFL season having paced the Patriots' WR room in targets during each of his first two years with the team. The 2023 sixth-round pick earned a significant offensive role early in his rookie season and took a slight leap forward last season, hitting career-best marks in targets, catches, yardage and TDs. One of the league's smallest receivers at 5-foot-8, 179 pounds, Douglas primarily works as a short-area slot receiver, which has severely limited his yardage, TDs and, of course, fantasy output. The 24-year-old has yet to deliver a top-55 fantasy campaign (PPG) and is a candidate for a lesser role in 2025 with Stefon Diggs now in the mix on what is likely to be a run-first offense under Mike Vrabel. Douglas has slight late-round appeal in PPR.

2025 Outlook:
Kirk was traded to Houston after spending his first seven NFL seasons in Arizona and Jacksonville. He peaked in 2022 when he posted career-high marks across the board and finished 18th among WRs in fantasy PPG, but that marks his only career top-30 season. Last season, he missed nine games and, while he did have a few solid outings (12-plus points three weeks in a row), he averaged a career-low 8.9 PPG on the season. With Tank Dell (knee) in doubt for 2025, Kirk will compete with rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel for No. 2 receiver duties opposite Nico Collins, and he figures to work as the team's primary slot receiver. There's not much upside here (he's cleared six TDs once in his career), so Kirk should be viewed as no more than a late-round pick.

Coker is entering his second NFL season after impressing as an undrafted free-agent signing in 2024. Coker stepped into a substantial offensive role in Week 5 and his route participation cleared 50% in each of his next 10 games. He handled a 16% target share (4.6 per game) from that point forward and averaged 9.3 fantasy PPG. He did nearly all of his damage with Adam Thielen or Xavier Legette sidelined, but did flash at times nonetheless, reaching 14 fantasy points three times. Coker figures to open 2025 behind first-round pick Tetairoa McMillan and Legette on the depth chart, so despite his strong showing as a rookie UDFA, he's worth no more than a late-round flier.

2025 Outlook:
Aiyuk is back in San Francisco for his sixth NFL campaign, but he's expected to miss roughly half of the season after suffering a torn ACL and MCL in October. Aiyuk had just received a contract extension, which followed back-to-back top-15 fantasy seasons, including a 2023 campaign in which he produced a career-high 1,342 yards (seventh among WRs) and ranked top 5 at the position in yards per reception, yards per target and yards per route run. Even prior to the injury, however, Aiyuk was underperforming last season, scoring zero TDs and reaching double-digit fantasy points once in seven games. Aiyuk is still in his prime at age 27, but it's unclear when he'll return, how effective he'll be, and how much work he'll be given in a fairly crowded offense. Aiyuk is only worth late-round consideration in deep leagues.

Palmer signed with the Bills during free agency after spending his first four NFL seasons with the Chargers. The 2021 third-round pick peaked with a 72-catch, 769-yard showing back in 2022, but that was only good enough for a 43rd-place finish in fantasy PPG. He's seen his TD total decrease each year since a career best four in 2021 and has missed 10 games due to injury over the last three seasons. The 25-year-old will battle with Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Curtis Samuel for wide receiver reps and is a long shot for consistent targets. He may occasionally make for a flex dart throw, but that's likely his ceiling.

2025 Outlook:
Doubs returns to Green Bay for his fourth NFL season. The 2022 fourth-round pick leads the team in targets (237), receptions (147), receiving yards (1,700) and receiving TDs (15) since his arrival, but that's resulted in only 9.5 fantasy points per game. He peaked with a 59-674-8 receiving line in 2023 and has yet to post a top-45 fantasy season (PPG). The 25-year-old has minimal upside (zero top-10 fantasy outings last season) and substantial competition for targets, with rookies Matthew Golden and Savion Williams joining a WR group that also includes Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks and eventually Christian Watson (ACL recovery). Add in an offensive scheme that leans heavily on Josh Jacobs near the goal line and Doubs' inconsistent usage and limited upside makes him no more than a bench option in fantasy.

2025 Outlook:
Harris was selected by the Chargers in the second round of April's draft. He is a tall, fast, perimeter WR whose absurd 5.20 YPRR last season was more than a yard higher than any other WR in this class. His 3.04 career mark also topped this class and came on a hefty 1,164 routes across 51 games. Harris' path to rookie-season work is tricky. While he easily could emerge as the team's top perimeter receiver, he could also begin his career behind behind Keenan Allen, Quentin Johnston and slot Ladd McConkey in target priority. Harris is a fine late-round flier, but has work to do in order to become a weekly fantasy starter.

2025 Outlook:
Marks was selected by Houston in the fourth round of April's draft. He was a pass-catching machine during his collegiate career, posting a 261-1,546-5 receiving line on 317 targets, more than doubling the next-closest back in routes, targets and catches. On the other hand, he ranked near the bottom of this RB class in YAC and forced missed tackle rate last season and during his career, including a career 2.41 YAC, which is easily worst in this class. Marks underwhelmed across the board at the combine, including a 4.54 40. The 24-year-old will immediately compete with Nick Chubb, Dare Ogunbowale and Dameon Pierce for touches while lead back Joe Mixon is sidelined (minimum four games). Marks is worth a flier in the late rounds of deep leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Miller is entering his third NFL season having accrued only 95 touches in 14 career games. That's a big letdown for a former third-round pick, and though a variety of injuries have been a culprit, he has yet to even lock down clear backup duties to Alvin Kamara when healthy. The good news is he's young (23), capable as both a rusher and receiver and should have a fresh start under a new coaching staff led by Kellen Moore. Kamara remains the lead back in New Orleans, but he turns 30 this year, which opens to the door for Miller to be a valuable insurance back if he can fend off Devin Neal for No. 2 duties. Miller is a fine late-round lottery ticket.

2025 Outlook:
Wilson is entering his third NFL season, including his second as Marvin Harrison Jr.'s running mate. The 2023 third-round pick was expected to make a Year 2 leap last season, but instead posted a receiving line (47-548-4) that was very similar to that of his rookie campaign (38-565-3) and in three more games. The 25-year-old's best season may be ahead of him, but he's going to be hard-pressed for consistent targets and fantasy output in an offense that features Harrison, Trey McBride and James Conner, and scores a substantial chunk of its touchdowns on the ground. Wilson's only path to the flex discussion will be if Harrison misses time, so he's not worth much late-round consideration.

2025 Outlook:
Cooper reunited with the Raiders in August. The 10-year vet came out of the gate averaging a career-high 27.5% target share (8.8 per game) with Cleveland last season, but Deshaun Watson's struggled allowed Cooper one showing over 10 fantasy points. He was then traded to Buffalo and his playing time and production were all over the map (three games with 14-plus fantasy points, but fewer than 8.0 in the other six). Prior to what was essentially a lost 2024 season, Cooper had finished no better than 14th and no worse than 32nd in fantasy PPG in his first nine seasons. Now 31 years old, it's possible he has another year of fantasy relevance left in the tank, but he'll be no higher than third in target priority behind Brock Bowers and Jakobi Meyers. Cooper is an acceptable late round flier in deeper leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Ertz returns to Washington for his 13th NFL season after a very successful debut campaign with the team. One season after being waived by Arizona and failing to find his way to another 53-man roster, Ertz won the Commanders' starting TE gig and ended up in the top 12 at the position in routes, targets, catches, yards, TDs and fantasy points. His 10 end zone targets ranked second at the position. Ertz is now 34 years old and has added competition for targets with Deebo Samuel Sr. in town and Ben Sinnott entering Year 2, so a step back in production is probable, but he'll continue to benefit from playing a role in a Jayden Daniels-led offense. Ertz is best viewed as a low-ceiling TE2.

2025 Outlook:
Strange is the new No. 1 tight end in Jacksonville following the release of Evan Engram. We got a preview of this last season when Engram was sidelined for eight games. In those weeks, Strange played 72% of the snaps and handled a solid 14.6% target share (4.9 per game). That led to one big fantasy outing (12-11-73-0 in Week 15), but he otherwise averaged 6.9 fantasy PPG and failed to clear 12.4 points in any of the other seven games. Perhaps Strange gets to another level in Year 3, but, especially with Brian Thomas Jr. and Travis Hunter set to be featured, the 2023 second-round pick seems likely to settle in as a low-ceiling TE2.

Smith was traded to the Steelers in June following a career year in Miami in which he finished top 5 among tight ends in targets, receptions, yards, fantasy points and touchdowns. This after never finishing better than 15th in the former four categories during his first seven NFL seasons. Smith's season actually started slowly (4.9 targets per game and one game with 12-plus fantasy points during Weeks 1-10), but he averaged 8.5 targets and a position-high 18.6 PPG from Week 11 on. Smith is now reunited with Arthur Smith, which isn't necisarily a good thing, as averaged single-digit fantay points during three prior seasons with Smith calling the plays. Pittsburgh is shaky at wideout, so Smith will play plenty, but his target ceiling is much lower with Pat Freiermuth also in the mix. Smith is best valued as a mid-to-back-end TE2.

Waller ended his one-year retirement and was traded to the Dolphins in July. Once a fantasy star, Waller produced back-to-back top-3 fantasy campaigns during the 2019-20 seasons and was top 10 on a per-game basis the following two years. Of course, he just sat out an entire season, is set to turn 33 years old this fall, hasn't played more than 12 games in a season since 2020 and hasn't averaged double-digit fantasy points in a season since 2021. On the plus side, he has an easy path to snaps and targets and will be working in an offense that faces a ton of two-high looks and allowed Jonnu Smith to produce high-end TE1 numbers for most of 2024. Waller is worthy of late-round flier.

The Steelers' early schedule sure looks good (@NYJ, SEA, @NE in Weeks 1-3), and potential growth in the sacks department buoys probable top-10 seasonal value.

Few NFL defenses are as talented and have as favorable a schedule in Weeks 1 and 2 (TEN, @IND) as the Broncos, making them the rare D/ST unit worth paying up for and sticking with for the duration.

Speed. Should all stay healthy, or some of the team's depth pieces materialize, this could be a sneaky, every-week unit. The Texans face a tougher early schedule (@LAR, TB in Weeks 1-2, @BAL in Week 5, Week 6 bye), but have several intriguing late-season matchups worth exploiting.

The Seahawks also benefit by drawing the NFC South and AFC South as opponents, giving them one of the more favorable schedules, particularly in the first six weeks (SF, @PIT, NO, @ARI, TB, @JAX).

Hutchinson's healthy return will help, but the Lions' schedule is a doozy, with six games against projected top-eight offenses. They have top-10 talent, but their soft matchups are few and their downside is greater than most.

Coming off a miserable 2024 that saw them place last in sacks (28) and 30th in fantasy points, the Patriots changed their head coach (Mike Vrabel) and defensive coordinator (Terrell Williams), then spent big on DE Harold Landry III, LB Robert Spillane and CB Carlton Davis III to bolster the defense. Is it enough to propel the D/ST into fantasy relevance? We'll see, but the Patriots do have one of the game's softest schedules, especially early in the season (LV, @MIA, PIT, CAR, @BUF, @NO, @TEN, CLE first eight games).

2025 Outlook:
Lou Anarumo comes over from the Bengals to serve as the defensive coordinator for a Colts team that has the beginnings of a strong defensive front with DT DeForest Buckner and DE Laiatu Latu, and added free agents S Camryn Bynum and CB Charvarius Ward to bolster what was a weak secondary. There's enough talent here to make the Colts a decent matchups play, and bear in mind that they have one of the position's more favorable schedules. Watch their performances in the first two weeks and consider adding them for Week 3 (@TEN).

The true shining star from the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX victory, Vic Fangio's defense features a stout secondary, All-Pro LB Zack Baun and first-round LB Jihaad Campbell, even if the unit suffered some key free agency losses (DE Josh Sweat, DT Milton Williams). After leading the league in fewest yards allowed, the Eagles will be a popular D/ST pick, but be mindful of their tough September schedule (DAL, @KC, LAR, @TB).

Bills general manager Brandon Beane was a man of his word this offseason, going all-in on a defensive line that finished 2024 with only 39 sacks. In addition to signing five-time Pro Bowl DE Joey Bosa, the Bills drafted defensive linemen in Rounds 2 through 4 (and six defenders overall), bolstering a roster that has finished eighth or better in fantasy points in four straight seasons. If you're speculating on a fifth straight, merely be patient through their treacherous Week 1 matchup (BUF).

Though the secondary has been the Jets' defensive strength the past two seasons, it was more inconsistent in 2024 and the team has since replaced departed CB D.J. Reed with Brandon Stephens. Nevertheless, new defensive coordinator Steve Wilks should get the most out of this unit, and an opening matchup against their former QB, Aaron Rodgers, and the Steelers is quite a good one. And looking beyond that, the Jets have very much the feel of an opportunistic, matchups-oriented D/ST.

Burden was selected by Chicago in the second round of April's draft. He is a bit undersized (his 8.5-inch hands tied for smallest in this class), but he's very young (21) and was highly relied upon and productive during three seasons at Missouri. He's fast with terrific playmaking ability and can align all over the formation. Burden is set to replace Keenan Allen as Chicago's slot man, but there are a lot of mouths to feed in an offense that also includes DJ Moore, Rome Odunze and Colston Loveland. Consistent Year 1 fantasy production is unlikely, so Burden is only worth a late flier.

Slayton re-signed with the Giants and is entering his seventh season with the team after they selected him in the fifth round back in 2019. He plays a lot of snaps (80%-plus snap share two years in a row), but he's not targeted much (4.4 per game last season) and hasn't finished a season better than 39th in fantasy PPG (or better than 54th since 2020). Slayton has yet to clear 770 yards in a season and he hasn't scored more than four TDs in a season since 2019. The 28-year-old will work opposite Malik Nabers (with Wan'Dale Robinson in the slot) again this season, and, even with a QB upgrade to Russell Wilson, he's well off the fantasy radar.

2025 Outlook:
Robinson was traded to the 49ers in August after leading Washington in carries during each of his first three NFL campaigns. While working in a committee with Austin Ekeler last season (eight full games, including the playoffs), Robinson handled 12.8 carries and 1.9 targets per game while playing 51% of the snaps. In those eight games, Robinson dominated goal-line work (four TDs and eight carries inside the 5), but wasn't a great fantasy option (11.1 PPG). The 26-year-old has missed two-plus games in all three pro seasons and has yet to finish better than 24th among backs in snaps, touches or yards. He's now positioned as a clear backup to Christian McCaffrey and is likely to see only a few touches each game. Robinson has some insurance appeal, but even if McCaffrey were to miss time, he'd likely share the backfield with Isaac Guerendo and would thus max out as a flex.

Westbrook-Ikhine signed with the Dolphins after spending his first five seasons in Tennessee. The 2020 UDFA has settled in as a reliable situational receiver and spot starter, having posted a target share in the 11-12% range four years in a row. Though he was limited to 60 targets last season, Westbrook-Ikhine broke math by scoring nine TDs on 32 catches. Eight of the scores game in an eight game stretch in which he caught just 20 passes and his WR-best 15.0% TD rate is obviously nowhere close to sustainable. The 28-year-old will battle for No. 3 WR duties behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. He should only be added to your roster in deep leagues if Hill or Waddle miss time.

2025 Outlook:
Lawrence is entering his fifth NFL season eyeing a bounce-back after an injury-plagued 2024. Lawrence played the bulk of the snaps in nine games and averaged 16.1 fantasy PPG. That would've ranked 15th over the full season and is actually a slight step back from 17.4 in 2022 and 16.4 in 2023. The former No. 1 overall pick has yet to deliver a top-10 fantasy campaign (PPG) and that's despite finishing each of his first three NFL seasons in the top 10 among QBs in pass attempts, carries and rush yards. Lawrence is a solid player who adds just enough with his arm and legs to hang in the QB2 mix. His ceiling has obviously been low, but perhaps the presence of Brian Thomas Jr., Travis Hunter and new head coach Liam Coen can get him to the next level. He's a fine but unspectacular late-round pick.

Ward was selected by Tennessee with the No. 1 pick in April's draft. Ward tossed a class-high 39 TDs and his 88.7 QBR trailed only Will Howard last season -- his lone year at Miami. He didn't run a ton, but was effective when he did (class-best 9.1 YPC and a ridiculous 79% of his 38 carries went for 5-plus yards). Ward is all but a lock to start in Week 1, and his supporting cast is serviceable, but there will be bumps along the way. So, unless he runs more than expected, he's unlikely to be more than an occasional streamer as a rookie. Consider him only as a late-round flier.

Penix is entering his second NFL season and his first as Atlanta's starter. The 2024 No. 8 pick played only three full games as a rookie, with mixed results. He threw for 200-plus yards and one INT in all three, totaling three passing TDs during the stretch. Though he did produce one rushing TD, he was (as expected) a nonfactor with his legs, totaling 11 yards on seven carries. Penix will benefit from a very good supporting cast led by Drake London and Bijan Robinson, but he'll be working in an offense that was third-run-heaviest in the league last season and he's unlikely to add much (if any) value with his legs. Penix should be viewed as no more than a late-round lottery ticket.

Thielen, who was traded back to the Vikings in August, returns for his age-35 season, continuing to defy the odds and play productive football. Granted, he missed seven games in 2024, but Thielen remained Bryce Young's top target and posted his fourth top-25 fantasy campaign (PPG) in his past five seasons. He played his best ball late in the season, averaging 7.7 targets per game and producing at least 15 fantasy points in four of his final six outings. Thielen doesn't have a high ceiling and is likely to play a lesser role behind Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, but he's still a reliable target (he's finished third in catch rate two seasons in a row). That's enough to keep him in the flex discussion while Addison serves a three-game suspension to open the season.

2025 Outlook:
Hopkins signed with the Ravens, which will be his fifth NFL team in 13 seasons. The future Hall of Famer was a featured target as recently as 2023 in Tennessee, but his usage dropped off drastically early last season (3.5 targets per game in six games with the Titans) and wasn't much better following a trade to Kansas City. He had one huge game (28.6 points in Week 9), but otherwise was a situational player, averaging 5.1 targets and 9.4 fantasy points per game in 13 outings with the team, including a very limited playoff role. Hopkins' days as a lineup lock are over and that's especially the case at 33-years-old in a run-friendly Baltimore offense that spreads the ball around quite a bit. Expect Hopkins to battle for No. 3 WR duties behind Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman. He's no more than a bench option.

Ayomanor was selected by the Titans in the fourth round of April's draft. He sports a solid size/speed combo, though he lacks some short-area burst (as shown by his class-worst 1.58 10-yard split at the combine). That didn't slow him from a huge workload at Stanford, as he handled a 32% target share and 47% air yard share (second highest in this class) last season. His efficiency was mostly below average, but there's potential here. Ayomanor will begin his career competing with Tyler Lockett and Van Jefferson (among others) for work behind Calvin Ridley. Ayomanor is only worth drafting in deep leagues and dynasty.

Bryant was selected by Denver in the third round of April's draft. He has decent size, but his lack of speed showed up at the combine (4.61 40-yard dash, 1.56 10-yard split) and his collegiate efficiency was fairly pedestrian. Bryant peaked with a 54-984-10 receiving line in 2024. On the plus side, he has a path to a major rookie-season role, with Marvin Mims Jr. and Troy Franklin as his competition for No. 2 duties opposite Courtland Sutton. Denver's Bo Nix-led offense is on the rise, so Bryant is well worth a flier in the late rounds.

2025 Outlook:
Atwell re-signed with the Rams during the offseason and is set to enter his fifth season with the team. The 2021 second-round pick has seen a progressive increase in receptions and yardage during each pro season, though he hasn't quite lived up to his Day 2 draft selection pedigree. Atwell has yet to post a top-60 fantasy campaign and, after failing to find the end zone in 2024, he has a total of five scores in 54 career games. Sean McVay has said that he will deploy Atwell more often moving forward, but the undersized 25-year-old remains well behind Puka Nacua and Davante Adams in terms of target priority. Atwell is not a fantasy option.

2025 Outlook:
Okonkwo has settled in as a consistent contributor in Tennessee, having finished each of his three seasons in the range of 450 to 528 yards and 5.7 to 6.7 fantasy PPG. The 2022 fourth-round pick has yet to finish a season better than 15th in targets, catches, yards or TDs. Scoring has been a clear issue, as Okonkwo has 10 end zone targets and six TDs in 51 career games. On the plus side, he saw a huge spike in work late last season, producing 199 yards on 23 touches during Weeks 15-17 (his 28 targets ranked first and 43.9 fantasy points second among TEs during the span). There aren't many mouths to feed in Tennessee, so it's possible the 25-year-old can carry that momentum into 2025, but he'll need decent play from rookie QB Cam Ward. Okonkwo is best viewed as a back-end TE2.

2025 Outlook:
Taylor was selected by the Jets in the second round of April's draft. He posted poor marks in YPT (7.2) and YPRR (1.20) across his 38 collegiate games, but Jason's son did catch 36-plus passes in all three seasons. Taylor is one of the youngest (21) tight ends in this class and may require some development, but he's also well positioned for a sizable Year 1 role with Jeremy Ruckert as his top competition for the starting job, not to mention the Jets' lack of depth at wide receiver. It wouldn't be a shock if Taylor finished 2025 second to only Garrett Wilson in targets, so even in what will be a low-volume passing game with Justin Fields under center, Taylor is a fine late-round dart throw in deeper leagues.

2025 Outlook:
McCloud is entering his eighth NFL season, including his second in Atlanta. The 2018 sixth-round pick spent his first six seasons as a bench/situational player for four different teams prior to enjoying a mini-breakout in 2024. Operating as Atlanta's No. 3 receiver, McCloud set career-best marks in targets, catches and yardage. He was able to manage only a 59th-place finish in fantasy PPG, however, as he found the end zone once and, incredibly, now has only three touchdowns on 177 career touches. The 28-year-old remains behind Drake London and Darnell Mooney on the Atlanta depth chart. He has minimal upside and is worth a late flier only in the deepest of leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Spears is entering his third NFL season after spending the first two in a backup/change-of-pace capacity. He'll miss, at least, the first four games of the season due to injury. The 2023 third-round pick was expected to take on a larger role, but instead was a clear second to Tony Pollard for most of the season. In 11 games with Pollard, Spears trailed in snaps (255 to 381), carries (64 to 150), routes (126 to 161) and targets (32 to 38). Spears saw a late-season boost in usage and scored four TDs in a two-game stretch, but he averaged 7.6 touches and 5.7 fantasy points per game prior to that, and Pollard is still atop the depth chart. Perhaps Spears will carry his late-season momentum into 2025 once he's back on the field, but odds are he'll remain a moderately-used receiving complement to Pollard. He's worth no more than a bench spot.

2025 Outlook:
Dowdle signed with Carolina after spending his first four seasons in Dallas. Rarely utilized during his first two years with the Cowboys, Dowdle worked his way up to a backup role in 2023 before fending off Ezekiel Elliott for lead-back duties in 2024. He appeared in 16 games and ranked in the top 20 among backs in carries, rushing yards, receptions, touches and scrimmage yards. Dowdle found the end zone only five times in Dallas' struggling offense, however, which limited him to a 24th-place finish in fantasy points per game. The 27-year-old showed well in a tough situation, but he'll enter 2025 as a clear backup to Chuba Hubbard, with rookie Trevor Etienne also a threat for work. Dowdle has some deep-league insurance appeal, though he would max out as a RB2/flex even if called on to start.

2025 Outlook:
Sanders signed with Dallas after failing to pan out during his two seasons in Carolina. Signed to a multiyear contract prior to 2023, Sanders was handed the Panthers' lead-back gig, but lost it to Chuba Hubbard within a matter of weeks. He went on to average 8.3 touches per game and score a total of two touchdowns in 26 outings prior to putting up a 116-yard, 2-TD showing with Hubbard sidelined last season. Perhaps that proves he still has some gas left in the tank, but now 28 years old and not much of a contributor as a pass catcher, it's unlikely Sanders will find his way to the fantasy radar. He'll battle Javonte Williams and rookie Jaydon Blue for work in Dallas, and is only worth a late flier in deep leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Following two solid but unspectacular seasons to begin his NFL career, Otton made a big leap in 2024, finishing in the top 15 among TEs in snaps, routes, targets, receptions, yards, TDs and fantasy points. Injuries around him were a factor, however, as he handled a solid 16% target share (4.8 per game) but was limited to a 29-307-1 receiving line (6.3 fantasy PPG and no games over 11.2) in 10 games with Mike Evans also in the lineup. Then, during Weeks 7-10 with Evans injured (Chris Godwin also missed most of this action), Otton handled a 25% target share (9.5 per game, 8-plus in all four) and posted a 30-293-3 receiving line (19.3 PPG with 18-plus three times). With Tampa Bay's loaded WR room and heavy reliance on its RBs, Otton figures to head back to low-ceiling TE2 production.

2025 Outlook:
Freiermuth is entering his fifth NFL season having yet to emerge as a viable fantasy starter. The 2021 second-round pick peaked with an 11th-place finish in fantasy PPG in 2022 and, despite catching a career-high 65 passes and matching a career best with seven TDs last season, he ended up 14th in PPG. One concern here is that the TD output is unsustainable, as Freiermuth ranked 20th in expected TDs (3.1, which aligned with where he was when he scored two TDs in both 2022 and 2023) and had a career-low two end zone targets. Another concern is the acquisition of Jonnu Smith, who even in an offense short on WR depth, is sure to cut into Freiermuth's target share. The arrival of Aaron Rodgers helps his cause a bit, and he may settle in second in target priority behind DK Metcalf, but there's not much of a ceiling here. Freiermuth is a mid-to-back-end TE2.

2025 Outlook:
Schultz is eyeing a rebound in 2025 after he followed up four consecutive top-12 fantasy campaigns with a 20th-place finish (28th in PPG) in 2024. Schultz posted a productive 59-635-5 receiving line in 15 games in 2023 (his first season in Houston), but saw his usage dip last season despite ranking fourth among tight ends in pass routes. He became a nonfactor near the goal line, totaling two end zone targets and two TDs, both of which are his fewest since taking on a regular offensive role in 2020. His history suggests a return to the fringe-TE1 mix is possible, and he could see a slight boost in targets with Christian Kirk and a pair of rookies set to replace Stefon Diggs (free agency) and Tank Dell (knee), but he also could lose work to second-year TE Cade Stover. Schultz doesn't have much late-round appeal.

2025 Outlook:
Young is entering his third NFL season looking to carry over the momentum from a strong finish to 2024. After a tough rookie campaign, the 2023 No. 1 pick was briefly benched last season prior to making a big leap once back in the lineup. Young played 10 full games from Week 8 on and averaged 18.0 fantasy PPG, which would've ranked 10th over the full season. He posted a pair of top-2 fantasy weeks in his final three outings. Young threw multiple passing TDs in each of those final three games, but perhaps most notable was his leap as a rusher (30-208-5 during his final eight games after totaling 294 yards and one TD in his first 22 pro games). Young still has a lot to prove, but the 23-year-old's late-season surge, as well as the arrival of first-round WR Tetairoa McMillan, is enough to make him worth late-round consideration on draft day.

Smith was traded to Las Vegas during the offseason. He reunites with Pete Carroll, who was Seattle's head coach when Smith posted career-best marks in passing yards (4,282), pass TDs (30) and fantasy finish (fifth, or ninth in PPG) in 2022. Smith's output has dipped quite a bit the last two seasons (22nd in PPG in 2023 and 16th in 2024), the latter despite ranking top 5 in pass attempts, completions and yards. He has evolved into a solid, albeit conservative passer who adds some value with his legs. His supporting cast in Las Vegas won't be quite as good as in Seattle, though Brock Bowers and Jakobi Meyers provide a pair of good targets. Now 34, Smith is best viewed as a fringe QB2 with limited upside.

2025 Outlook:
Darnold signed with Seattle after enjoying a breakout 2024 campaign in Minnesota. Playing with the lead often (league-high 53% of plays) in Kevin O'Connell's QB-friendly scheme, Darnold finished top 10 among QBs in pass attempts, completions, pass yards, pass TDs, INTs, sacks and carries. He had multiple TD passes in 12 games and had a solid fantasy floor with 16-plus points in 12 games. Despite the big box score numbers, Darnold finished "only" 18th in QBR and isn't going to move the needle much with his legs (career high in rush yards is 222), so it's fair to expect a step back in a Klint Kubiak-led offense that swapped out DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett for Cooper Kupp and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Darnold is best valued as a fringe QB2 with minimal upside.

The 2023 fourth-round pick impressed, especially as a receiver, in a limited rookie-season role (115 touches), but with D'Andre Swift brought in as lead back in 2024, Johnson dripped to 71 touches. That wasn't enough to allow consistent fantasy value, but he was busy near the goal line, matching Swift's six TDs and eight carries inside the 5 yard line. The 25-year-old enters 2025 competing with rookie Kyle Monangai to be Swift's primary backup. Johnson has some late-round insurance appeal.

Hunt re-signed with the Chiefs following a successful reunion with the team last season. He stepped in for an injured Isiah Pacheco in Week 4 and went on to average 21.5 touches, 89.0 yards and 14.8 fantasy points over the next eight games. Pacheco returned in Week 13 and then neither were viable fantasy options from that point forward, as they were near even in snaps, carries and targets, with Samaje Perine also in the mix as a passing-down specialist. Hunt was not particularly effective as a rusher or receiver and he's now 30 years old, so it's fair to expect a healthy Pacheco to lead this backfield in 2025. Hunt is only a late-round consideration.

The 2024 third-round pick opened the season third on the Rams' depth chart and, though he eventually passed Ronnie Rivers, he was never a threat to Kyren Williams' feature-back role. Corum wasn't overly impressive as a rookie, but he makes for an intriguing insurance stash, because Williams has totaled a massive 663 touches (third most) over the past two seasons, including the playoffs. Should Williams miss time, Corum would likely share the Rams' backfield with rookie Jarquez Hunter. He's barely worth a late-round flier.

Lloyd is entering his second NFL season after being limited to one game during his rookie season. The 2024 third-round pick produced 18 yards on seven touches while playing 10 snaps in Week 2. Ankle and hamstring injuries then knocked him out for a few months and appendicitis ended any chance of a return. The 24-year-old may be the future lead back in Green Bay, but he'll begin his second season on IR and will then battle for backup/change-of-pace duties behind feature back Josh Jacobs. The role is unlikely to lead to standalone value, but there's plenty of insurance appeal here in an offense that allowed Jacobs 337 touches (fifth most) last season. Lloyd is a fine add once healthy.

He was solid efficiency-wise as a collegiate rusher but struggled with drops and may cap out as an early-down option. He'll battle Tyler Goodson for primary backup duties behind feature back Jonathan Taylor and, thus, has some late-round insurance appeal.

Lockett signed with the Titans after spending his first 10 seasons in Seattle. The 2015 third-round pick peaked with five consecutive top-16 fantasy campaigns from 2018 to 2022, but slipped to 32nd in 2023 before plummeting to 66th last season. Lockett's role drastically declined last season (74 targets after 107-plus the prior five years), which led to his worst showings in catches, yards and TDs since 2017. While he's expected to operate as Tennessee's No. 2 receiver behind Calvin Ridley, Lockett is now 32 years old and will be working with a rookie quarterback in Cam Ward. He's worth no more than a late flier.

2025 Outlook:
The 21st overall pick back in 2023, Johnston had the look of a bust after struggling to a 38-431-2 receiving line as a rookie. Things improved under a new coaching staff in Year 2, with Johnston doubling his rookie-season target share (from 11% to 22%) and scoring eight TDs (12th most among receivers). His production was inconsistent, however, as 43% of his fantasy points came in three games and he had seven single-digit outings. He finished 39th or lower in snaps, routes, targets, catches, yards and fantasy PPG, so, if he's going to join the WR3/flex discussion, he'll need a volume boost in order to offset TD regression to the mean (4.8 xTD). That boost is unlikely, as he'll now have to battle Keenan Allen and rookie Tre Harris for work behind Ladd McConkey. Johnston is barely worth a late flier.

2025 Outlook:
Watson is entering his fourth year with the Packers, but he's unlikely to return before midseason after suffering a torn ACL in Week 18 of last season. The injury is yet another setback for a player who has missed 13 regular season games, including, at least, two all three years. Even when healthy, the 2022 second-round pick has failed to live up to his pedigree, having yet to produce a top-30 fantasy campaign. He's all but settled in as a situational deep threat, ranking second in aDOT each of the last two seasons. On the plus side, Watson ranked second among receivers in YPT (11.5) and YPR (21.4) last season, which allowed a career-high 620 receiving yards. Perhaps a healthy Watson will eventually find his way back to fantasy relevance, but the 26-year-old is well off the radar in 2025.

2025 Outlook:
Mitchell is eyeing a leap forward in his second season after he was limited to 35% of the offensive snaps as a rookie. The 2024 second-round pick found himself buried behind Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Josh Downs for most of the season, which led to inconsistent usage and one outing with double-digit fantasy points. He was targeted often when on the field (54 targets on 193 routes), but his vertical role, coupled with poor QB play (league-high 41% off target rate), led to a position-worst 43% catch rate and zero TDs. Mitchell's second-round pedigree places him on the breakout radar, but his hands will be full overcoming the team's WR depth (all three of Pittman, Pierce and Downs are back) and ongoing QB question marks. Mitchell is no more than a late-round lottery ticket.

2025 Outlook:
Lazard is entering his eighth NFL season, including his third with the Jets. With old friend Aaron Rodgers under center, Lazard came out of the gate strong last season, totaling a 26-354-5 receiving line (15.2 fantasy PPG) in his first six games. Once the Jets acquired Davante Adams, however, Lazard's usage plummeted and he managed an 11-176-1 line (5.8 PPG) in his final six games. Lazard has a shot at No. 2 WR duties opposite Garrett Wilson this season, but with Rodgers out and dual-threat Justin Fields in at quarterback, there's almost no upside here. Lazard has never posted a top-30 fantasy campaign (one finish better than 47th) and he's unlikely to get there in his age-29 season.

2025 Outlook:
Iosivas is entering his third NFL season after working as a situational target during his first two campaigns. The 2023 sixth-round pick posted a 15-116-4 receiving line while playing 26% of the snaps as a rookie prior to leaping to a 78% snap share in 2024. Despite the generous playing time in the league's pass-heaviest offense, as well as several missed games by Tee Higgins, Iosivas cleared five targets only twice (Weeks 1 and 3) and averaged just 7.1 fantasy PPG. The 25-year-old finished last among 88 qualified wide receivers in YPRR (0.9) and, even if he fends off second-year Jermaine Burton for No. 3 duties, he'll be a minimal threat for consistent targets. Iosivas shouldn't be drafted.

The Giants have the makings of a potentially elite pass rush, having drafted DE Abdul Carter third overall to add to an already strong group including DEs Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux and DT Dexter Lawrence II. This unit should pile up sacks, but it's also in a precariously tough spot in terms of schedule, as five of its first eight games are against top-eight projected offenses, and the team has a league-low two games all season against bottom-eight offenses.

S Antoine Winfield Jr., DT Vita Vea and LB Lavonte David provide a strong core, and the addition of DE Haason Reddick can only help strengthen the defensive front. Consider the Buccaneers for in-season matchups, including their pair of divisional games against the Saints and Panthers and Week 3 against the Jets.

2025 Outlook:
Wright is entering his second pro season after totaling 71 touches in 15 games as a rookie. The 2024 fourth-round pick spent most of his first year as a clear depth option behind De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert, often time splitting No. 3 duties with Jeff Wilson Jr. He failed to find the end zone or reach 9.0 fantasy points in a single game. Achane is back as the clear lead back in 2025, but with Mostert and Wilson gone, Wright will compete with rookie Ollie Gordon for primary backup duties. That's enough to provide the 22-year-old with some late-round insurance appeal, though he'll miss time to open the season due to injury.

He is 5-foot-8 with the shortest arms in this RB class and he didn't show too well at the combine, running a 4.60 40 and tying for the shortest broad jump (117). His collegiate stats are underwhelming for the most part, though some of that seems to be team-related, as his 1.52 yards before contact across 47 games is lowest in this class, whereas he was solid in YAC (3.30) and forced missed tackle rate (4.2). Monangai will open his career battling Roschon Johnson for No. 2 duties behind D'Andre Swift.

Neal was selected by the Saints in the sixth round of April's draft. He isn't super-fast (4.58 40-yard dash, 1.59 10-yard split), but has decent size and was a solid producer during four seasons at Kansas. That tenure included 760 carries (second most in this class), the second-best elusiveness rating and solid receiving efficiency on 102 targets. Neal is a long shot for fantasy relevance, but the Saints' backup situation seems wide open behind 30-year-old Alvin Kamara. If Neal can overtake Kendre Miller for the No. 2 job, he'll have some sneaky insurance appeal.

Mostert's improbable career rolls on, as the 33-year-old signed with the Raiders during free agency. Undrafted back in 2015, Mostert was severely limited by injuries throughout most of his career, totaling 320 touches prior to reaching 200 in back-to-back seasons in Miami (2022-23). Mostert's career year came in 2023 when he scored a league-high 21 touchdowns, but he predictably crashed back to earth with two scores on 104 touches last season. Mostert cleared 12 touches and 11.8 fantasy points only once last season and heads to Las Vegas as a clear backup to rookie Ashton Jeanty. He's barely worth late-round consideration in deep leagues.

Guerendo, 24, is entering his second NFL season after playing a limited role off the bench for most of his rookie campaign. Granted, it was a small sample (99 touches), but the 2024 fourth-round pick was effective as both a rusher (5.0 YPC) and receiver (94% catch rate, 9.5 YPT). With Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason battling injuries, Guerendo played at least half the snaps in four games. In those weeks, he averaged 16.8 touches, 101.0 scrimmage yards and 17.9 fantasy points. The 49ers replaced Mason with Brian Robinson Jr. during the offseason, leaving Guerendo as a longshot to fantasy relevance. He'll only be worth adding should McCaffrey miss time and even then he may not be a starting option.

Hunter was selected by Rams in the fourth round of April's draft. He ranked top 4 in this class in both YAC (4.06) and forced missed tackle rate (3.2) last season and was sixth or better in both categories for his career. He didn't stand out as a receiver or at the combine, however, and could be limited to a two-down (and returner) role in the pros. Hunter will open his career behind feature back Kyren Williams and second-year Blake Corum, so he'll be worth adding in fantasy only if Williams misses time with an injury.

Pierce is entering his fourth NFL season. In 12 games in which Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs were also active last season, Pierce handled 12% of the targets (3.8 per game) and cleared five in a game only once. If we filter to the six games played with Anthony Richardson, Pittman and Downs, Pierce averaged 3.8 targets and 4.4 fantasy points per game, failing to score a TD or clear 10.4 fantasy points in any of the outings. No higher than third on the WR depth chart and a candidate for less work as Adonai Mitchell enters Year 2 and with TE Tyler Warren now in the mix, Pierce is way off the fantasy radar.

Fantasy managers piecing a D/ST strategy together could do worse than the Cardinals, who beefed up their defensive line with the signings of DE Josh Sweat and DT Calais Campbell, and face one of the league's most favorable early schedules. Their Weeks 1 and 2 matchups are a dream (@NO, CAR), and they're in similarly good shape through Week 6. Regard the Cardinals as a strong streaming candidate, with the possibility of the unit developing into something more as the season plays out.

All-Pro S Xavier McKinney, LB Edgerrin Cooper and DE Rashan Gary return to comprise the heart of the Packers' defense, which, due to a lack of cornerback depth, should be susceptible to the matchups. The opening two weeks are ones to avoid (DET, WAS), but the season's middle chunks should provide fantasy managers opportunities.

Johnson is entering his second NFL season after playing a hefty 84% of the Giants' offensive snaps as a rookie. The fourth-round pick didn't see much work in the passing game early on and missed the final five games due to injury, but he was picking up steam prior to going down. After totaling a 14-150-0 receiving line on 20 targets (7% share) during his first eight games, Johnson leapt to a 15-181-1 line on 23 targets (19%) in the final four outings. The fantasy output wasn't great in the Giants' punchless offense, but the increase in reliance is notable and it will only help having Russell Wilson under center. The 24-year-old Johnson is a fine sleeper target in the late rounds.

Arroyo was selected by Seattle in the second round of April's draft. A seam stretcher, Arroyo's 10.0 aDOT last season at Miami ranked second and his 16.9 YPR and 12.6 YPT first in this TE class. He also led this class in YPR, YPT, RAC and adjusted catch rate for his career. Incredibly, Arroyo is charted as having zero career drops. The important context here is that Arroyo was a rarely used target (61 in 34 games, 47 of which came in 2024). He has long-term fantasy upside, but will open his career battling second-year A.J. Barner for work. Arroyo is the better pass-catching prospect of the two, so he's a sleeper to consider in the late rounds of deep leagues.

Higbee made his season debut in Week 16 and went on to appear in five games, including the playoffs. Unsurprisingly, he didn't play much of a role initially, but he seemed back to his usual self in the playoff game against the Eagles, posting a 7-54-1 receiving line on 10 targets. Higbee has enjoyed spurts of fantasy relevance at times throughout his career, but he's never finished better than 10th in PPG, and even that was way back in 2019. The 32-year-old will settle in no higher than third in target priority behind Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, so he's not worth your attention in the late rounds.

2025 Outlook:
Tolbert is back in Dallas for his fourth NFL season. A situational player during his first two campaigns, Tolbert played 76% of Dallas' offensive snaps in 2025. That didn't translate to much usage, however, as he averaged just 4.6 targets per game. Tolbert scored seven TDs, but ranked outside the top 50 receivers in targets, catches, yards and fantasy PPG. The 26-year-old will play a lesser role in 2025 after Dallas added George Pickens as the team's No. 2 receiver behind superstar CeeDee Lamb. Even with a healthy Dak Prescott, Tolbert is a poor bet to come close to weekly flex production.

2025 Outlook:
Jones signed with the Colts and beat out Anthony Richardson for the team's starting job. The 2019 first-round pick struggled with injuries (zero full seasons) and ineffectiveness (career 6.5 YPA) during six seasons with the Giants. After throwing 24 touchdowns in 13 games as a rookie, Jones totaled 45 pass TDs in 57 games the following five seasons. He finished one season better than 15th in fantasy PPG and that eighth-place finish in 2022 was primarily a product of big-time rushing (120-708-7). The 28-year-old isn't going to move the needle as a passer, but he could land on the streaming radar due to his legs (60-plus carries in four of the last five seasons). Especially considering that early struggles could lead to a benching in favor of Richardson, Jones is, at best, a QB2 only worth drafting in superflex.

2025 Outlook:
Rodgers signed with the Steelers and, though he will be the team's starter in 2025, he is unlikely to provide starting-caliber fantasy numbers, as at age 41, his high fantasy upside is a thing of the past. After posting zero weekly finishes better than ninth in his prior most recent full season (2022), he managed one finish better than eighth in 2024. He's still able to put up passing numbers (top 8 in attempts, yards and TDs last season), but is a nonfactor with his legs (107 rushing yards last season was actually his highest since 2020).�In Pittsburgh, Rodgers will be working in Arthur Smith's run-heavy scheme with a shaky supporting cast. He's well off the fantasy radar.

2025 Outlook:
Wilson signed with the Giants following a one-year stint in Pittsburgh. In 11 starts for the Steelers, he averaged 15.7 fantasy PPG and managed only two weekly finishes better than 10th. Wilson remained serviceable as a passer -- he now has 42 pass TDs to 13 INTs over the past two seasons (26 games) -- but wasn't much of a factor with his legs (career-low 155 yards). Wilson finished 15th in fantasy PPG, which marks his fourth straight season outside the top 12. The 36-year-old has Malik Nabers at his disposal, which will help keep him in the weekly QB2 conversation, but there's simply not much upside here and he could eventually cede his job to rookie Jaxson Dart.

Flacco signed with the Browns and won the team's Week 1 starting job over Kenny Pickett and rookies Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel. Flacco appeared in five full regular-season games with the Browns in 2023 and seven with the Colts last season. He averaged 16.7 fantasy PPG during those 12 games, which is fairly impressive considering he was a nonfactor with his legs (18-28-0 rushing line). Flacco did his damage through the air, throwing two or more TDs in 10 of the 12 outings. Of course, Flacco is now 40 years old, hasn't appeared in more than nine games in a season since 2017 and is a poor bet to play out the whole season with three young QBs on his heels. Flacco is only worth drafting in superflex.

2025 Outlook:
Cooks reunited with the Saints -- the team that drafted him in 2014 -- after bouncing around the league (four stops) since departing New Orleans in 2017. The former first-round pick has had his stretches of WR2 production (seven of 11 seasons have resulted in a top-25 finish in fantasy PPG), but he hasn't had a finish better than 37th since 2021 and he fell to a career-low 76th in 2024. Now 31 years old, Cooks is expected to slide in as the Saints' No. 3 receiver behind Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed. He'll likely see a handful of targets most weeks, but consistent fantasy output is a long shot, especially with Spencer Rattler and/or rookie Tyler Shough under center. Cooks is worth consideration only in the late rounds.

He didn't get much run at Michigan (235 carries in three seasons) and was a complete nonfactor as a receiver, totaling an 8-67-0 line on 14 career targets. Mullings will battle with Julius Chestnut for a depth role behind lead backs Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears.

2025 Outlook:
Etienne was selected by Carolina in the fourth round of April's draft. Travis' brother was effective as both a rusher and receiver (3.46 YAC, 3.8 forced missed tackle rate and class-best 91% catch rate) during his three seasons at Florida and Georgia. Size (5-foot-8, 198 pounds) could limit his NFL workload ceiling, but Etienne has a three-down skill set and is one of the youngest backs in this class. He'll spend his rookie campaign developing behind lead back Chuba Hubbard and likely Rico Dowdle, and will eventually battle Hubbard and Jonathon Brooks for work in a suddenly crowded Carolina backfield. Etienne is worth rostering only in deep and dynasty leagues.

Smith was selected by the Chiefs in the seventh round of April's draft. He is one of the smallest RBs in this class (194 pounds) and, while he ran a solid 4.39 40 at the combine, he showed poorly in the vertical (32.5) and broad (117). A converted WR, Smith was elusive but otherwise pedestrian as a rusher in his lone season as a collegiate RB. He'll open his career behind Isiah Pacheco, Kareem Hunt and Elijah Mitchell, and may settle in as a kick returner/reserve in the pros.

2025 Outlook:
McLaughlin is entering his third NFL season, having primarily played a rotational role during his first two seasons in Denver. The 2023 UDFA reached a career high with 137 touches in 2024, but he's yet to play more than 42% of the snaps in a single game. That's no surprise and unlikely to change considering his 5-foot-8, 187-pound frame. Denver did take a look at him in an expanded role during his final four games of 2024 (10-plus touches in all four, including a career-high 18 in Week 18), but he failed to reach double-digit fantasy points in any of them, nor did he clear 12.6 points in any of his 16 games last season. The 24-year-old has some juice, but he's likely to remain a depth back behind newcomers J.K. Dobbins and RJ Henry and has minimal fantasy value.

Steve Spagnuolo's defense is a sound, point-prevention-style unit that rarely burns fantasy owners week to week, but it isn't the flashy type that'll carry your matchup in a given week. The Chiefs return a similar roster in 2025, led by All-Pro DT Chris Jones, LB Nick Bolton and CB Trent McDuffie, meaning another good-not-elite season should be in order. Note, however, that the Chiefs' first-half schedule (five matchups against top-eight projected offenses) is much tougher than its second half. This could be a prime in-season D/ST target.

The Bears' defensive strength is in their secondary, where CB Jaylon Johnson is a two-time Pro Bowler, though the addition of DT Grady Jarrett should help improve the team's line. Dennis Allen, who oversaw the Saints' better defensive seasons of the past decade, was also brought on as defensive coordinator. Nevertheless, the Bears D/ST has its work cut out in the competitive NFC North, rendering it merely an in-season streamer.

Johnson returns for his sixth season in New Orleans after a solid 2024 showing in which he set career highs in catches and yardage while appearing in every regular-season game for the first time in his career. The converted wide receiver has finished between 18th and 26th in fantasy PPG each of the past three seasons, though it's notable that he saw a boost in usage and production following Taysom Hill's injury late last season (12-plus points in three of his final five games). Hill is a long shot to play in 2025, though the team will be in better shape at wide receiver with a healthy Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed, as well as newcomer Brandin Cooks. Playing with rookie QB Tyler Shough and/or Spencer Rattler, Johnson, 28, is no more than a fringe TE2.

Gesicki re-signed with the Bengals after a strong finish to his first year with the team. After falling completely off the fantasy radar the prior two seasons, Gesicki finished top 15 in routes, targets, catches, yardage and end zone targets in 2024. He struggled to find the end zone (exactly two TDs for the third time in four seasons), but finished 18th in fantasy PPG. Gesicki was boom/bust (four games with 14-plus points, but 11 with 9 points or fewer), but he peaked late with position-best marks in targets (22), catches (18), receiving yards (154) and fantasy points (33.4) during Weeks 17 and 18. Gesicki is a situational player and will need to fend off newcomer Noah Fant, but he will benefit from Joe Burrow and the league's pass-heaviest offense. He's a bench option in deep leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Likely is back for his fourth NFL season after quite the head-scratcher of a season in 2024. He came out with a bang with 12 targets and a TE-high 26.1 fantasy points in Week 1, but failed to come close to either number the rest of the season. He did find the end zone six times in 16 games, but a lack of volume allowed him only 6.5 fantasy PPG after the season opener. Playing behind (or alongside) Mark Andrews the past three years, Likely has yet to finish a season among the top 20 tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, catches or yardage. His 20th-place finish in fantasy PPG last season was a career best. Perhaps Likely's best days are ahead of him, but consistent fantasy value is a long shot as long as Andrews is on the roster. The 25-year-old does not need to be drafted.

2025 Outlook:
Sanders is headed into his second NFL season following a solid rookie campaign in which he played 55% of Carolina's offensive snaps. He flashed a bit while playing an expanded role when Tommy Tremble was sidelined for four games near midseason (5.0 targets and 10.9 fantasy points per game), but the rookie was limited to a situational role in the 11 games Tremble was active (2.0 targets and 2.6 PPG). Sanders will be a candidate for more work in his second season, but he's still very young (22) and will continue to share work with Tremble. The 2024 fourth-round pick is only worth a late flier in deeper leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Fant signed with the Bengals. The 2019 first-round pick enjoyed moderate fantasy output during his first three NFL seasons (all in Denver), but was all but a nonfactor during three campaigns in Seattle. Fant has yet to post a top-10 fantasy campaign on a per-game basis, and after finishing in the top 12 among TEs in targets, catches, yards and fantasy points in both 2020 and 2021, he failed to finish better than 15th in any of those categories during the three seasons with the Seahawks. Fant has scored a total of one touchdown over the past two seasons. The 27-year-old is not worth late-round consideration, but would leap into the TE1/2 mix if Mike Gesicki were to miss time.

2025 Outlook:
McMillan enters his second NFL season as a bit of a tricky evaluation. The 2024 third-round pick opened his rookie season as a de facto full-time player, but was rarely targeted behind Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. He was finally featured during the final five regular-season games and exploded for a league-high seven TD catches (at least one in all five outings) and 19.8 fantasy PPG (at least 16.7 points in all five). Of course, Godwin was out during that stretch and, even if he misses some time in 2025, the team drafted Emeka Egbuka in the first round of April's draft. Consistent fantasy production will be hard for McMillan to find with Evans, Godwin and Egbuka in the mix, not to mention that he's expected to miss a big chunk of the season due to injury.

TeSlaa was selected by Detroit in the third round of April's draft. He is the only WR in this class who had zero recorded drops during his Division I tenure, though his 1.48 YPRR while at Arkansas is lowest among all WRs in this rookie class. He showed well at the combine, though, including a 4.43 40 at 214 pounds. TeSlaa will operate as the No. 3 or 4 receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams and perhaps Kalif Raymond this season. He's only worth rostering in deep leagues and dynasty.

2025 Outlook:
Rattler beat out rookie Tyler Shough and will be the Saints' Week 1 starting quarterback. Rattler - a 2024 fifth-round pick - appeared in seven games as a rookie and did not show particularly well. He completed 57% of his passes, averaged 5.8 yards per attempt (both are very poor) and managed four TDs and five INTs. He did add a bit with his legs (146 yards), but that wasn't enough to allow a single 15-point fantasy outing. The 24-year-old is unlikely to hang on to the starting job all season and is well off the fantasy radar.

Aaron Donald's retirement following 2023 proved no disaster, as Defensive Rookie of the Year DE Jared Verse stepped in as an immediate leader up front. The secondary, however, is another matter, as the team rotated six cornerbacks through the starting lineup and don't appear in any better shape at the position entering 2025. This is a sack-oriented, matchups-oriented D/ST, but at least Weeks 2 (@TEN) and 4 (IND) provide good opportunities early.

2025 Outlook:
After the Jaguars finished bottom 5 in the league in points and yards allowed, sacks, turnovers and, yes, fantasy points last season, they brought in both a new head coach (Liam Coen) and defensive coordinator (Anthony Campanile). The goal: To coax more out of DEs Travon Walker and Josh Hines-Allen and LB Devin Lloyd, all of them first-round draftees. If you're the gambling type, that first-week matchup is tasty (CAR), but the wiser play is to monitor this defense, which has most of its better matchups during the season's second half.

That said, four-time All-Pro LB Fred Warner and 2022 Defensive Player of the Year DE Nick Bosa are capable of carrying this defense when healthy, and the team faces one of the most favorable D/ST schedules, beginning with @SEA and @NO the first two weeks.

All credit to Jesse Minter for transforming what was a bottom-10 defense in 2023 to the league's best at point prevention in his first season as defensive coordinator. Still, the team cooled as the season progressed, three times scoring negative points in the final eight weeks, and it made few personnel improvements during the offseason. An opening-week Chiefs matchup is a hard “no” in fantasy, but the team does have a wealth of favorable matchups after that leading up to its Week 12 bye.

Dart was selected by the Giants in the first round of April's draft. He paced this rookie class in aDOT (11.1), YPA (10.8) and efficiency rating (181) last season despite dealing with a class-high 5.8% drop rate. Dart is a factor with his legs, as his 9.6% scramble rate ranked second last season and he ran for 2,009 yards in 45 collegiate games. His rushing ability could eventually help him to fantasy relevance, but he is expected to open his career behind Russell Wilson and perhaps Jameis Winston. Dart should only be drafted in superflex, though he'll be worth an add in all formats if promoted to starter.

2025 Outlook:
Shough was selected by the Saints in the second round of April's draft. He is the oldest QB in this rookie class (25), having spent his seven collegiate seasons at Oregon, Texas Tech and Louisville. He completed only 63% of his passes last season and for his career, but has a big frame, good arm and adds some value with his legs (career 196-1,109-11 line). Following Derek Carr's shocking retirement in May, Shough will slot in as the Saints' No. 2 QB behind Spencer Rattler. Shough figures to eventually earn starts this season, but even if he's on the field, he's unlikely to emerge as a consistent fantasy option in an offense that is expected to struggle in 2025. Shough should not be drafted.

The Texas Tech product ran for 1,500-plus yards in both 2023 and 2024 and also caught at least 27 passes each of the past three seasons. He's strong and quick with decent size. Brooks figures to begin his career buried behind lead back Chase Brown, as well as complementary option Samaje Perine.

Singletary is headed into his seventh NFL season, including his second with the Giants. The veteran back opened the 2024 season as New York's lead back (72% snap share and 16.5 touches per game during Weeks 1-4), but after missing the next two games, he returned to a backup role behind Tyrone Tracy Jr. From that point on, Singletary played 27% of the snaps and averaged 6.2 touches per game. The 28-year-old is a solid player with three 215-plus touch seasons under his belt (2021-23), but he's going to have a hard time seeing the field behind Tracy and rookie Cam Skattebo in 2025. He can be ignored on draft day.

2025 Outlook:
Richardson enters his third NFL season as a backup behind Daniel Jones. On one hand, the 2023 No. 4 overall pick has a ton of upside; he ranked no lower than sixth among QBs in carries, rush yards and rush TDs last season despite playing only 10 full games, while also pacing the position in average depth of throw and yards per completion. That led to four games with 20-plus fantasy points. On the other hand, Richardson's poor passing may land him on the bench. He had fewer than 15 fantasy points in his other six outings, threw 12 INTs on the season (fourth most) and his 48% completion percentage ranked last. In total, he averaged 15.8 fantasy PPG in the 10 games, which would've ranked 15th over the full season. Richardson's elite rushing ability and aggressive passing style will put him on the weekly QB1 radar when he's in the lineup, but we may not see that for quite a while. He doesn't need to be drafted.

2025 Outlook:
Mayer is entering his third NFL season. The 2023 second-round pick didn't make much noise as a rookie (27-304-2 receiving line in 14 games) and was limited by the presence of target hog Brock Bowers, as well as some time away from the team (personal reasons) last season. Bowers actually played a pretty healthy share of the snaps (63%, including 74% from Week 14 on) last season, but he was targeted more than four times in only one of 11 games, which also marked his only game over 6.1 fantasy points. The 24-year-old may someday emerge into a fantasy star, but his receiving numbers will be severely limited as long as he's playing alongside Bowers. He should only be rostered in dynasty.

Sinnott is eyeing a leap forward in his second NFL season after he played a limited role as a rookie. The 2024 second-round pick appeared in all 17 of Washington's regular season games, but with Zach Ertz dominating the tight end targets and John Bates also involved, Sinnott was limited to five targets on 293 snaps. The team likely still views Sinnott as its tight end of the future, but he's not the tight end of the present, as Ertz was signed to an extension during the offseason and Bates is also back. Perhaps the 22-year-old can overtake Ertz at some point this season, but that's not enough incentive to roster him anywhere except in dynasty leagues.

Ferguson could be the starter in Los Angeles as soon as 2026, but in the meantime he'll battle Colby Parkinson and Davis Allen for snaps behind starter Tyler Higbee.

His 6.5 aDOT last season was easily the lowest in this rookie class, but he made it work, completing 73% of his passes and he was off target on a class-low 6.0% of his aimed throws. He was way more aggressive during multiyear stints at Oklahoma and UCF, and his overall collegiate efficiency is terrific, including QB rating (class-best 161) and QBR (78.8). He's an older prospect and undersized, but adds some value with his legs (career 311-1,895-33 line). Gabriel will begin his career behind Joe Flacco and will hope to earn starts ahead of he, Kenny Pickett and fifth-round rookie Shedeur Sanders this season. He'll be worth drafting in superflex only if he wins the job.

Sanders was selected by Cleveland in the fifth round of April's draft. He completed a class-best 74% of his passes and avoided INTs (1.43%) in his two seasons at Colorado (24 starts), though it's worth noting he was conservative (7.4 aDOT is third lowest in this class) and took a ton of sacks (8.64% rate, second highest). He adds a bit with his legs (117-687-8 line during his time at Colorado), which will help his fantasy stock if he moves ahead of Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett and third-round rookie Dillon Gabriel and takes over Cleveland's starting gig. Sanders is worth drafting only in dynasty and superflex.

Milroe was selected by Seattle in the third round of April's draft. Last season, Milroe threw only 16 TDs in 13 games and his 3.45% INT rate was easily the worst in this class. Some of the latter can be traced to an aggressive game, as his career 10.2 aDOT tops this rookie class. Additionally, his career 79.6 QBR is second best in this class. There are accuracy concerns, but he has a good arm and terrific speed and agility, having posted elite rushing numbers last season (145-906-20). Milroe could eventually find his way to fantasy relevance, but he'll begin his career as a clear backup to Sam Darnold.

2025 Outlook:
Cousins remains a trade candidate after a disappointing season in Atlanta. The veteran quarterback entered the 2024 season with high expectations after he had finished his prior six full seasons in the top 10 in pass TDs, as well as seven of his prior nine full seasons in the top 12 in fantasy points per game. Instead, he finished 30th in QBR, paced the NFL with 16 INTs and continued to add nothing with his legs (zero yards on 23 carries). Cousins managed three weekly finishes better than 15th prior to being benched for Michael Penix Jr. in Week 16. Perhaps Cousins will bounce back now that he's more than one year removed from Achilles surgery, but considering he's now 37 years old, it's unlikely he'll find his way back into the QB1 mix.

2025 Outlook:
Allen was selected by the Jaguars in the seventh round of April's draft. His rushing efficiency at Syracuse is concerning (class-low 4.5 YPC), but he has the biggest hands in this RB class and his 83 targets and 64 receptions last season were tops in this RB class. He'll look to carve out a third-down role in the pros, but it may take a while, as Travis Etienne Jr., Tank Bigsby and fourth-round rookie Bhayshul Tuten top the Jacksonville depth chart.

2025 Outlook:
Dissly is back for his eighth NFL season, including his second with the Chargers. Dissly somewhat quietly soaked up a solid 14.9% target share last season, but that wasn't enough to allow consistent fantasy production. His career-high 481 receiving yards ranked 22nd at the position and he remains a minimal producer in the touchdown department (his career high of four came way back in 2019). Dissly has yet to produce a top-20 fantasy campaign and is a good bet for a dip in targets with pass-catcher Tyler Conklin added to the Los Angeles tight end room. Dissly enters his age-29 campaign well off the fantasy radar.

2025 Outlook:
Gray is entering his fifth season with the Chiefs, all of which have been as a backup to Travis Kelce. Gray's usage and production has increased during each of his pro seasons, which includes career-best marks in targets, catches, yards and touchdowns last season. Gray generated some hype when he scored four of his five touchdowns during a two-game stretch, but that proved fluky, as he averaged just 3.3 targets and 5.1 fantasy PPG the rest of the season. The 26-year-old is not worth your attention on draft day, but would be a worthwhile waiver add if 35-year-old Kelce were to miss time.

Helm was selected by the Titans in the fourth round of April's draft. His career 80% catch rate is best in this class (min. 25 targets), but he wasn't used a ton (99 targets and a 6% share in 55 games) in a good Texas offense. He underwhelmed at the combine, running a 4.84 40 at 241 pounds and posting a class-low 30-inch vertical. Helm will handle backup duties behind Chig Okonkwo, and is not a short-term fantasy option.

2025 Outlook:
Fannin was selected by Cleveland in the third round of April's draft. The 2024 Bowling Green offense ran through Fannin, as he handled a massive 39% of the targets and air yards. That allowed him a 117-1,555-10 receiving line on 155 targets, as well as a 3.83 YPRR. Every stat I've listed so far was the best among TEs in this class. He showed decent speed and athleticism at the combine, so along with his good hands, Fannin could emerge as a pass-catching threat in the pros. In the meantime, he'll battle for situational snaps behind starter David Njoku. Draft Fannin in dynasty leagues only.

2025 Outlook:
Gadsden was selected by the Chargers in the fifth round of April's draft. A converted receiver (the position his father played in the pros), Gadsden had two highly productive campaigns, having posted a 61-969-6 receiving line in 2022 and a 73-934-7 showing in 2024. He handled 20% of the Orange's targets during the 36 games he was active and his career 10.76 aDOT was the second highest in this TE class. He's more of a receiver than a blocker, which means perhaps there's some eventual fantasy appeal here, but he'll open his career buried behind Will Dissly and Tyler Conklin.

Knox is entering his seventh NFL season, including his third as Dalton Kincaid's running mate. The 2019 third-round pick flirted with top-12 fantasy output in the two years prior to Kincaid's arrival, but has since seen a severe dip in usage, plummeting to career-low marks in targets (33), touchdowns (one) and fantasy PPG (3.7) last season. That was despite Kincaid missing three games (Knox averaged 5.7 PPG those weeks). In total, Knox had zero double-digit fantasy outings in 2024 and his last game over 10.2 points was Week 16 of 2022. Even if Kincaid misses time, 28-year-old Knox won't be a starting option in fantasy.

Kmet enters 2025 having finished better than 16th in fantasy PPG once in his career, a ninth-place finish in 2023. He finished in the top 10 among TEs in all key categories that season, but plummeted to outside the top 20 in targets, catches, yards and fantasy points in 2024. In what was a bit of a bizarre season, Kmet appeared in all 17 games, paced all tight ends in snaps, finished fifth in routes and led the position with an 84% catch rate, but ended up 27th in fantasy PPG. He had two games with double-digit targets but three with zero. The 26-year-old's fantasy stock took a massive hit in April when Chicago spent its first-round pick on Colston Loveland. No longer positioned for more than the occasional target or two, Kmet is well off the fantasy radar.

Musgrave is entering his entering his third NFL as the clear No. 2 tight end in Green Bay. The 2023 second-round pick opened his career as the team's clear starter, but was passed by Tucker Kraft (a 2023 third rounder) when sidelined with an injury during his rookie season. Kraft locked down the starting job during the 2024 offseason and hasn't looked back. Musgrave missed 10 more games last season and was unproductive when active, playing 31% of the snaps and totaling 10 targets in seven outings. The 24-year-old will only be worth a speculative add if Kraft were to miss time in 2025.

2025 Outlook:
Conklin signed with the Chargers after spending the first seven years of his career with the Vikings and Jets. The veteran tight end has finished top 10 among tight ends in pass routes each of the last four seasons, though that hasn't allowed much fantasy production. He finished either exactly 16th or 18th in fantasy points all four years and was in the 18th-to-23rd range on a per-game basis each year. Conklin has proven reliable (he's missed two games in his career) but he's not targeted quite enough, nor does he score enough touchdowns (11 in seven seasons) to allow starter-level production in fantasy. Conklin may lead the Chargers' TE room in targets, but with Will Dissly also in the mix, he's no more than a fringe TE2.

2025 Outlook:
Taylor is returning for his 15th NFL season, including his second straight as the primary backup for the Jets. Of course, after backing up Aaron Rodgers last season, Taylor will serve the same role behind newcomer Justin Fields in 2025. Taylor only attempted 22 passes last season and has averaged 68.7 attempts per season since 2018, maxing out with 180 in 2023. Taylor still adds a little bit of value with his legs and that helped him to three 17-plus fantasy point showings in four full games back in 2023. The 36-year-old is not worth your attention on draft day and, if called on to start, will be no more than a back-end QB2.

Rudolph is back with the Steelers following a one-year stint in Tennessee. Rudolph, who spent his first four seasons with Pittsburgh, played the bulk of the snaps in seven games for the Titans last season. He threw as many TDs (nine) as he did INTs (nine) and has still yet to clear 20.0 fantasy points in a single game in his pro career. Rudolph was not particularly effective and his 6.7 YPA and 64% completion percentage on 228 attempts last season exactly mirror his career rates. The 30-year-old will back up Aaron Rodgers this season and, even with DK Metcalf, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth at his disposal, won't be a fantasy option even if asked to make a few starts.

Minshew signed with the Chiefs and is expected to operate as Patrick Mahomes primary backup this season. This will be the journeyman's fifth team in seven seasons and he made multiple starts at each of his prior homes (Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Las Vegas). Minshew has yet to play a full regular season and his best fantasy campaign was a 19th-place finish in 2019 (he was 13th on a per-game basis in 2020, but only appeared in nine games). Minshew played in 10 games with the Raiders last season, but threw more INTs (10) than touchdowns (nine) and eventually lost his starting job to Aidan O'Connell. Minshew is well off the fantasy radar and would only join the QB2 conversation if Mahomes were to miss time.

Winston signed with the Giants after spending his first 10 NFL seasons with the Buccaneers, Saints and Browns. He's primarily been a backup and spot-starter over the past five seasons, but he made seven straight starts in relief of injured Deshaun Watson last season. The result was what you expect from Winston, as he had his share of big plays (both good and bad) and ended up with 12 pass TDs and 12 INTs. Winston is likely to back up Russell Wilson and perhaps rookie Jaxson Dart this season. If called upon to start, he may add some big-play opportunities for the team's pass catchers, but will be no more than a desperation streaming option in deep leagues.

Pickett was traded to the Raiders (which came just months after a trade to the Browns) after spending his first three NFL seasons with the Steelers and Eagles. The 2022 first-round pick was serviceable in limited work in relief of Jalen Hurts last season, but struggled as the Steelers' starter during his first two years in the league (6.3 YPA, 13 pass TDs, 13 INTs). Pickett showed some rushing ability as a rookie (55-237-3), but followed with a 42-54-1 line in 2023. Pickett would need a Geno Smith injury in order to see the field, but even if called on to play, Pickett is a long shot to make a leap to fantasy relevance.

The ultimate risk/reward fantasy defense, the Cowboys were ravaged by injuries in 2024 (CBs DaRon Bland and Trevon Diggs and DEs DeMarcus Lawrence and Micah Parsons missed a combined 33 games), finished third in sacks and had four defensive touchdowns. They'll hope for more luck on the health front under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, but it's tough to see a path back to the top of the fantasy leaderboard with so many NFC East and AFC West games on their schedule, beginning with a “no way” Week 1 matchup against the Eagles.

2025 Outlook:
The Dolphins put forth a much better real-life season than fantasy defensively in 2024, finishing inside the top 10 in points and yards allowed, but 27th or worse in sacks, turnovers and defensive touchdowns. Other than the free-agent departure of Jevon Holland, which left them precariously thin at safety, the Dolphins return largely similar personnel. This is a matchups-oriented D/ST, and most of the good ones come in the season's first half (especially @IND, NE in Weeks 1 and 2).

2025 Outlook:
The Titans allowed the second-fewest yards but fifth-most points last season, as frequent turnovers by their dreadful offense put their defense in constantly awful field position. On paper, the Titans don't have much worth celebrating, with DTs Jeffery Simmons and T'Vondre Sweat among the highlights, but they do have one of the league's softest D/ST schedules. If they look competent early, they could have many midseason matchups to exploit.

2025 Outlook:
Few teams get as little defensive pressure as the Falcons, who have finished in the bottom 2 in sacks in three of the past four seasons. That was a catalyst to the team drafting Jalon Walker and James Pearce Jr., as well as signing Leonard Floyd, to bolster the defensive line. That'll help Jeff Ulbrich in his first season as defensive coordinator, but he has a lot of work to do before making this a fantasy-relevant unit. On a positive note, the Falcons do have a long stretch of favorable matchups in November.

As if the Browns needed anything more stacked against them, their defense draws one of the most brutal September schedules: CIN, @BAL, GB, @DET (plus MIN to begin October). Between that and LB Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah's being out for the season, this is more of a wait-and-see unit than one to draft, despite its No. 3 finish in fantasy points in 2023. But there is talent here, including five-time All-Pro DE Myles Garrett and No. 5 overall draft pick DT Mason Graham.

Thanks in part to the additions of LBs Frankie Luvu and Bobby Wagner, the Commanders improved from fantasy's worst D/ST in 2023 to 23rd last season, a noticeable improvement but one still reflecting a large amount of room for growth. S Will Harris and DT Javon Kinlaw join the fray for 2025, a boost but unlikely enough to push this team into the upper tier at the position. Hey, at least the Commanders' Weeks 1 (NYG) and 3 (LV) matchups are worth a look.

Under new defensive coordinator Brandon Staley (and new head coach Kellen Moore), the Saints will shift from a 4-3 to 3-4 base defense, presenting a challenge for an aging unit lacking in cornerback depth. Between DE Cameron Jordan, LB Demario Davis and S Tyrann Mathieu, there's enough here to make a matchups case when all are healthy, but the Saints are middling in terms of schedule favorability, with only four matchups against bottom-eight projected offenses.

2025 Outlook:
Much of the Bengals' defensive prospects hinge upon their getting an extension done with All-Pro sack leader DE Trey Hendrickson. The team frequently engages in high-scoring affairs, making the D/ST susceptible to bad matchups, meaning lots of homework for fantasy managers. That said, new defensive coordinator Al Golden's unit does get a pair of dreamy assignments to begin 2025 (@CLE, JAX), so perhaps managers can capitalize on those before formulating an exit plan.

Beyond that, there's little cause for excitement with this unit, which has a below-average D/ST schedule from a matchups perspective. Hey, at least we can say they begin 2025 hosting the Patriots.

Defensively speaking, the Panthers' 2024 was a flat-out disaster. They surrendered a record 534 points, became one of only five teams this century to allow 30-plus points and 400-plus yards per game, and were ravaged by multiple injuries to key defenders. Having a healthy DT Derrick Brown back will surely help, and the Panthers' first seven games don't include a single truly terrifying D/ST matchup. Still, this is a matchups-oriented defense at best.

He has decent size, tested solid in Indy and posted good collegiate numbers in terms of raw totals (265-3,615-27 receiving) and efficiency (2.49 YPRR, 69% catch rate). He's battling for work as Seattle's No. 3 receiver.

2025 Outlook:
Williams was selected by New England in the third round of April's draft. He is an undersized receiver (5-foot-10, 190 pounds) who soaked up a ton of work in college, totaling a 248-3,608-29 receiving line. When active, he handled 25% of the targets and 31% of the air yards during his five collegiate seasons. Drops were an issue, but he used his speed to produce well after the catch (6.4 RAC). There are a lot of bodies in the Patriots' WR room, but with Stefon Diggs (31 and recovering from a torn ACL), DeMario Douglas, Kayshon Boutte and Mack Hollins among the top competition, Williams easily could emerge as a starter if he proves to be the real deal. The 22-year-old is a late-round lottery ticket in deep leagues.

2025 Outlook:
Thornton was selected by the Raiders in the fourth round of April's draft. He is a vertical threat who ranked at or near the top of this WR class in YPR (25.4), YPT (18.9), aDOT (16.4) and RAC (10.7) last season, albeit in a situational role (35 targets, 9% share). In fact, Thornton was used sparingly throughout his four collegiate seasons, totaling a 6.1% target share (second lowest in this WR class) and 65-1,426-10 receiving line. He posted the best speed score (120) among WRs at the combine (4.30 40 at 6-foot-4, 205 pounds). Thornton is likely headed for a situational deep-threat role behind Jakobi Meyers and perhaps Amari Cooper (not to mention TE Brock Bowers), and he should be drafted only in deep or dynasty formats.

Bech was selected by Las Vegas in the second round of April's draft. He was used sparingly for much of his first three collegiate seasons prior to busting out with a 62-1,034-9 showing in 2024. He can align all over the formation and figures to do most of his damage in the short-to-intermediate range. With, at least, Jakobi Meyers and Brock Bowers ahead of him for targets, Bech is unlikely to make a short-term impact. The TCU product doesn't need to be drafted, but is a name to keep on your watch list.

Dike was selected by Tennessee in the fourth round of April's draft.

He can align all over the formation and showed well at the combine (4.34 40), but may be destined for backup WR and special teams work. He'll battle the likes of Van Jefferson and fellow fourth-round rookie Elic Ayomanor for snaps behind Calvin Ridley and Tyler Lockett this season. Dike is well off the short-term fantasy radar.

2025 Outlook:
Noel was selected by Houston in the third round of April's draft. He has a below-average frame with small hands and short arms, but that didn't stop him from showing well at the combine, where he tied for the highest vertical (41.5) and posted the longest broad jump (131). Primarily a short-range (8.0 aDOT) slot receiver (71%), Noel also worked as a kick and punt returner at Iowa State. Even with Tank Dell unlikely to play this season, Noel will need to battle Christian Kirk, Justin Watson and second-round rookie Jayden Higgins for work behind Nico Collins. He's a long shot for consistent rookie-season production, but is a fine dynasty stash.
